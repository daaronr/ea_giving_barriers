<h3 class="unnumbered" number="">Non-technical abstract</h3>
<p>Hunger, homelessness, mental and physical illness, environmental degradation: the needs are boundless, but the resources to solve these problems are limited. Even with the best of intentions and impressive generosity (Americans give roughly 2% of their income to charity!), donors often contribute to inefficient charities – ones that spend more but accomplish less than others that may be competing for the same funds. Each dollar given to the most effective charities (like those rated by <a href="http://givewell.org"><span class="underline">Givewell.org</span></a>) benefits greater numbers of people in more significant ways than the least effective ones. However, donors do not always consider “Effective Altruism” (EA) when deciding how much to give and to which organizations.</p>
<p>Academics (in Economics, Psychology, Biology, and Philosophy) have applied a range of theories to explain what drives “inefficient altruism.” Evidence comes from a variety of studies, involving surveys, observational work, laboratory experiments, and, where feasible, natural field experiments.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These have not been run as part of a systematic project addressing this issue; goals, contexts, and approaches have varied as opportunities presented. Given the disparate findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors impact effective giving.</p>

<!-- (Or put in section 2?) -->
<p>Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another… when and how? This is critical to understanding the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to ‘switch’ from other charities. To the extent this is the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressure you to give to local orgs) themselves represent barriers to EA giving (see below).</p>

<p>Overview of research Question/Problem: Why don’t people give in an evidence-based way?</p>
</div>
<p>When faced with the <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/videos#pondvideo">“girl drowning in the pond”</a> we are willing to sacrifice substantial wealth to save a life. However, <a href="https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2017-total-charitable-donations-rise-to-new-high-of-390-05-billion/">most people don’t make large donations to the very poor</a>, in spite of evidence suggesting that lives can be saved <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness">for less than $10,000</a>. This is not for lack of generosity. There is a strong case that most donations go to charities that improve well-being far less per-dollar than others.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>As Hoffman et al (2018) state:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>This raises two related questions: 1. “Why don’t we give more to the most effective charities and to those most in need?”, and 2. “Why are we not more efficient with our giving choices?” To address this, we must understand what drives giving choices, and how people react to the presentation of charity-effectiveness information.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Note that these two questions are not identical: the first asks about the amounts given to the most needy charities, and the second about the choice of charities conditional on giving.</p>

<p>Individual donors, governments and firms demonstrate substantial generosity (e.g., UK charity represents 0.5-1% of GDP, US charity around 2% of GDP).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, most donations go towards charities that are worthwhile but improve human well-being far less per-£ than basic medical interventions in poor countries, such as antimalarial bednets (see Givewell.org). Even within the same category, more can be achieved for less: e.g., while it costs about USD 40,000 to provide a blind person a guide dog, each USD 100 given for mass-distribution of ivermectin may prevent 10-50 years of river-blindness.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<!-- TODO: source for Ivermectin claim --></p>
<p>Social science, biology and philosophy present a range of potential theoretical explanations of how values, preferences, and biases drive this ‘inefficient altruism’. However, evidence (e.g., for ‘availability bias’, or for ‘scope insensitivity’) comes largely from small-scale experiments in domains outside of charitable-giving. It is difficult to distinguish robust, credible findings from one-off results that are vulnerable to hype, p-hacking and publication bias (echoing the ‘replication crisis’ in experimental social science). Given the limited, scattered findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors substantially impact ‘effective giving and support for policies that reduce extreme poverty’. (We give a review of papers surveying this evidence <a href="#prevsurvey">below</a>)</p>
<!-- TODO: Reference survey articles for the above -->
<p>A plain-language summary of key points, without references (unfold):</p>

<div class="fold">
<p><strong>Charities’ impact differs by an order of magnitude:</strong> Some charities are much more effective at saving/improving lives (and achieving other goals such as those involving animals and the environment) than others are. While it is difficult to gain precise estimate on the measures such as “cost of a life saved” there is strong evidence that there are orders of magnitude difference between different categories of charities and different interventions within these categories.</p>
<p>**There are some very effective lifesaving charities: Some interventions seem likely to save or vastly improve individual lives at a cost in the range of $2000 - $10,000. When people are asked whether they would be willing to spend this amount or even a vastly larger amount to save a life in other contexts they typically will agree to do so.</p>
<p><strong>There are two related and largely unresolved puzzles:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Why are people not more generous with the most highly effective causes? and</p></li>
<li><p>When they give to charity why do they not choose more effective charities?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>There is some evidence on this but it is far from definitive.</strong> We do not expect there to be only a single answer to these questions; there may be a set of beliefs, biases, preferences, and underlying circumstances driving this. We would like to understand which of these are robustly supported by the evidence, and will have a sense of how important each of these in terms of the magnitude of driving and absence of effective giving. There has been only a limited amount of research into this and it has not been systematic, coordinated, nor heavily funded.</p>
<p><strong>We seek to understand because we believe that there is potential to change attitudes, beliefs, and actions</strong> (primarily charitable giving, but also political and voting behaviour and workplace/career choices). Different charitable appeals, information interventions and approaches may substantially change peoples charity choices. We see potential for changing the “domain” of causes chosen (e.g., international versus US domestic) as well as the effectiveness of the charities chosen within these categories. (However, we have some disagreement over the relative potential for either of these.)</p>
<p>Our main ‘policy’ audience includes both effective nonprofit organisations and ‘effective altruists’. The EA movement is highly-motivated, growing, and gaining funding. However, it represents a niche audience: the ‘hyper-analytic but morally-scrupulous’. EA organisations have focused on identifying effective causes and career paths, but have pursued neither extensive outreach nor ‘market research’ on a larger audience (see <a href="http://www.charityscience.com/operations-details/scaling-down-charity-science-outreach">Charity Science</a>, <a href="http://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ideas42-Best-of-Intentions_Charitable-Giving-1.pdf">Gates Foundation/Ideas42</a>).</p>

<h2 number="2.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Definitions - “Efficiency” versus impact</h2>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Consider: The measures used are relevant to how we consider issues such as charity ‘quality ratings’ and ‘overhead aversion.’</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to define the concept of talking about. What, precisely, is this <code>effectiveness'' or</code>impact’’ of a charity we are focusing on? It is not trivial to get this right and there are some delicate and hotly debated questions even within the EA movement. Nonetheless, I sketch the basic idea in the math below.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(G_j\)</span>: The total donations given to charity <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> during some interval; i.e., the Cherry’s income.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(B_j(G_j)\)</span>: A function defining the beneficial <em>outcome</em> achieved by charity <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with the total donations <span class="math inline">\(G_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, we are referring to <span class="math inline">\(B_j(G_j)\)</span> as (the improvement to ) some <em>ultimate outcome</em>: Lives saved (i.e., deaths averted), quality adjusted life years (QALY) added, QALY weighted by age, Disease-adjusted (DALY), future happy lives generated, sentient suffering averted, etc.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>As noted, there are disagreements over how and whether we should trade off among these outcomes. Issues such as population ethics, andthe importance of sentience and experience — come to the fore. We will ignore these for now.</p>
</div>
<p>The important distinction here: <span class="math inline">\(B(G_j)\)</span> does not refer to a simple intermediate <em>‘output’</em> such as ‘antimalarial nets provided’ nor ‘textbooks purchased’. We are referring to the social <em>outcome</em> of ultimate value; an outcome that could be valued in and of itself.</p>
<p>This naturally takes into account <em>both</em> the ‘technical efficiency’ in terms of how many units of output can be produced per dollar, and the rate at which each unit of this output boosts the ultimate outcomes of interest.</p>
<br />

<div class="note">
<p>The ‘production function’ is (perhaps tautologically) the product of two terms:</p>
(Total or marginal) impact per dollar = output per dollar <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> impact per output
</div>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>This is obviously an oversimplification. To achieve the beneficial outcome the charity will require many intermediate inputs (or “outputs” as noted above), including ‘management’ and ‘careful targetting of programs’. Some charities may be able to acquire these inputs at better prices than others, and some may also use a more efficient mix of inputs.</p>
</div>
<p>A donor may care about the ‘impact’ of her own donation; i.e., she may want to know the difference in outcomes that her donation achieves everything else equal. In other words, the difference in the ultimate outcome in a world with versus without her donation.</p>
<p><strong>Small donor assumption</strong>: For a small donor (perhaps someone who donates less than USD 100,000), we may assume that this “rate of benefit” will be the same for both the first and the last dollar she donates.</p>
<!-- TODO -- how to tag and refer to assumptions and equations in R markdown? -->
<p>Thus we consider the <em>marginal</em> impact, as a simplification:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(B_j^\prime (G_j)\)</span> for the marginal donor.</p>
<p>I assert that <span class="math inline">\(B_j^\prime(G_j)\)</span> is the quantity that GiveWell (and perhaps other EA charity raters) are attempting to measure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<em>We know:</em>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>[CITE evidence here]</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math inline">\(B_j^\prime(G_j)\)</span> is much larger for the most <em>impactful</em> relative to the most <em>popular</em> charities.</p>
<p>Increased benefits could be achieved if donations were ‘’reallocated’’ towards more impactful charities. An individual who gains value from her giving through it’s <em>impact</em> alone would naturally donate to only the <em>one</em> charity that has the greatest marginal impact, the charity <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with the greatest <span class="math inline">\(B_j&#39;(G_j)\)</span> term. If every donor is doing this, then as an ‘equilibrium’ result <em>every charity receiving positive donations should have the same last-dollar marginal impact.</em> In maths:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

B_k^\prime(G_k) = B_j^\prime(G_j)\forall j,k s.t. G_j&gt;0, G_k&gt;0
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This assumes a single impact goal, essentially ‘cause neutrality’.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea that each donor gives only to a single charity essentially depends on the above ‘Small donor assumption’. Still, allowing that the marginal-benefit-leading-charity may vary within the range of an individuals’ donation simply implies that they should allocate among multiple charities each up to the point that the last dollar given yields the same marginal benefit as the other charities, yielding the above result. We can imagine an equilibrium in which all donors give to multiple charities, with each of these charities being virtually “tied” in their marginal effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But we do <em>not</em> seem to be doing this. Again: billions are given to charity, and these charities clearly have vastly different marginal impacts, even among those that seem to target very similar outcomes.</p>

<h3 number="2.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Conceptual breakdown of ‘barriers’ (first presentation)</h3>
<p>We focus on the ‘barriers’ or ‘hurdles’ to giving effectively among individuals who <em>already</em> engage in some charitable giving and other-regarding acts. Loosely, a donor would need to jump over all of these hurdles and cross each of these barriers in order to be giving effectively.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Recall: is there a well-known psychological framework for these sorts of multiple-hurdle choices?</p>
</div>
<p>We first consider a fairly <em>conceptual</em> breakdown. (In later sections, we will use a less theoretically precise categorization that proved more practically usable.)</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Later chapters presents the direct and indirect evidence for very specific barriers, with real-world examples, and proposed ‘tools’ for surmounting these. Here the conceptual breakdown proved difficult, as most of the real world cases fell into multiple theoretical categories.</p>
</div>

<div class="note">

<p>The discussion above largely assumes that people are, at least to some extent:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Other-regarding/pro-social: her preferences or ger “utility function they are maximizing” incorporates the well-being of others, at least to some extent</p></li>
<li><p>Moral utilitarians: The value she places on helping others (or on others’ outcomes) is principally increasing in some measure of the <em>amount</em> of good they have done for others, or in others’ welfare. For a given personal sacrifice, she will always prefer to have made more people more well-off than to have made fewer people less well-off. In Economics terms, she strictly prefers and values <em>Pareto-improvements</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>A mathematical statement of this may be helpful here.</p>
</div>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Universalist: In considering others’ welfare, she values all others equally regardless of their identity.</li>
</ol>

<div class="note">
<p>Universalism: a more precise example:</p>
<p>Consider a world with three other people (B,C,D), begin in a Poor state. Consider outcomes such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>B and C are well off and D is poor</p></li>
<li><p>D is well-off and B and C are poor</p></li>
</ol>
<p>She would always prefer outcome 1 over outcome 2. She would also rather achieve outcome 1 over outcome 2 with her charity, <em>no matter the identity of persons B, C, and D.</em></p>
</div>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Not ‘deontological’: there are no other relevant absolute moral constraints (constraints such as ‘do no harm in your actions, even if others are helped’)</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To what extent does a ‘moral utilitarian’ (MU) consequentialist ethic govern beliefs and behaviour? To the extent it <em>does</em>, limited effective giving represents a puzzling intention/action gap.</p>
<p>However, for non-utilitarians this is no puzzle. If other forces and motivations drive our giving choices, we might not expect these to be aligned with effectiveness.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the above is posed too starkly. People may embrace concepts such as utilitarianism, universalism, and cause neutrality, and at the same time be largely driven by other concerns and sympathetic to other moral frameworks. We may agree with statements that “all lives are equal” and “we should strive to do the most good for the largest number” but also support maxims such as “charity begins at home” and “giving is about supporting something you have a personal connection to.”</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>While these statements may, strictly speaking, be contradictory, we shouldn’t expect perfect consistency or constancy. Most people are not asked to rigidly join the deonological or utilitarian camp, and those who have not studied philosophy or social science may never have contemplated these issues directly.</p>
</div>
<!-- TODO: Citations here; I recall having seen evidence  and argumentation suggesting that people are far from consistently in one camp or another -->
<p>Perhaps moral utilitarianism (MU) is relatively unimportant in most people’s charitable choices. Even if this is the case, understanding the ways in which people do pursue their giving goals, and their obstacles and “biases” in doing so may suggest ways of making giving more impactful. For example, many donors may prioritize their local community, leading to their less-effective giving (from a universalist point of view). However, they might be persuaded to expand their definition of their own ‘community’.</p>
<!-- Even if this is the case, specific campaigns, tools, and fundraising approaches may still help align their parochial, self-interested, or reputation-seeking values and intentions with more effective giving. -->
<p><br />
</p>

<p>People may (at least to some extent) <em>want</em> to be effective in their donation. However, they may simply not be good at doing this. Quantitative biases may drive departures from effectiveness in general. Anything that causes me to misunderstand effectiveness, to misapprehend the nature of the “production function for good outcomes”, or to misjudge charities will lead me astray from effective giving. if I am making any mistake, I am failing to optimize.

<p>Social signaling is seen to be a major driver of human behavior, particularly in the charitable domain.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Essentially, we may make choices that we would not have otherwise made in order to boost our reputation among our peers, colleagues, etc.. Reputation may be valued for its own sake or instrumentally, as a means to inducing others to act more favorably to us. Game theory (see esp. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Spence1973"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>) offers a precise conception of this signaling as a costly way to demonstrate one’s positive “type” in a context with asndymmetric information.</p>
<p>Several authors (can be interpreted to) suggest that valuing ‘’effectiveness in generosity’‘, i.e., moral-utilitarianism, is seen as a negative signal by peers and lowers fitness in the cooperation market, at least in comparison to signaling compared to deontological or ‘sacred values’. The exchange below captures the basic argument…</p>

<div class="note">
<p><em>From Robin Hanson and Rob Wiblin exchange on 80000 hours podcast; see Chapter 12 of “The Elephant in the Brain” (Hanson)</em><br />
</p>
<p>Hanson: But of course people spend a lot of time directly helping even when they’re relatively well-paid and they could pay other people who earn much lower wages to do a lot more.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Wiblin: This is the example of the high-flying lawyer dishing out soup in a soup kitchen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hanson: … the alternative theory that we suggest is that you are trying to show that you feel empathy. That is you want to show there is an emotional capacity in you such that if you see someone around you in need you will feel like you want to do something about that. And existing charities do tend to successful show that. They show somebody who needs help in a direct way that invokes your emotions and you do help to some degree, you do the thing that people would say would help and that shows people around you that you’re not an uncaring person and it might show them, for example, that if they were in need of help later and they were near you you would see them and you would feel about them too. You want to show people that you will be useful ally. If either of you is in trouble the other will come to their aid.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Wiblin: So why is it more important to show the people that you’re the kind of person who if they someone in pain that they’re going to try to help them right then and there than to show that you’re the kind of person who’s smart enough to think about which charities are useful and does their research and actually tries to help people? Because if you don’t care about whether charities are effective or not, my thoughts would just be that you’re not really going to pay attention to whether you’re actually helping your friends or not?</p>
<p><br />
Hanson: Right, but at least if I want your help and I’m your friend it will be my job to put myself in your face and to tell you about my problem. And maybe I figure I coul successfully get myself in front of your face and make you pay attention to my problem and help you understand what I think is effective and then you would just do what I say, and that’s maybe what I’m mostly hoping for. And if you were this person who thinks carefully about how to help the best person in the world who needs help, well I’m plausibly not going to be that best person in the world who needs help so I’m not going to win out in that contest so it’s not actually going to be that useful to know you as the sort of person who will help the person in the world who needs the most help.</p>

<p><span class="citation">(Everett, Pizarro, and Crockett <a href="#ref-everettInferenceTrustworthinessIntuitive2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> argue that deontological ethics signal stable cooperative behavior to others, which enhances fitness in mutualistic partner choice models. The basic argument is “An individual who claims [and believes] that stealing is always morally wrong … seems much less likely to steal from me than an individual who believes that the stealing is sometimes morally acceptable depending on the consequences.”</p>
Background and further discussion … in fold

<div class="fold">
<p>The authors’ motivation is to explore why “intuitive moral judgments often”share characteristics with deontological theories while “consequentialist judgments are often the result of slow, deliberative cognitive processes”. Their key theoretical argument cites “mutualistic partner choice models of the evolution of morality”, which…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>posit a cooperation market such that agents who can be relied upon to act in a mutually beneficial way are more likely to be chosen as cooperation partners, thus increasing their own fitness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the typical deontological reason for why specific actions are wrong is that they violate duties to respect persons and honor social obligations-features that are crucial when selecting a social partner. An individual who claims that stealing is always morally wrong and believes themselves morally obligated to act in accordance with this duty seems much less likely to steal from me than an individual who believes that the stealing is sometimes morally acceptable depending on the consequences. Actors who express characteristically deontological judgments may therefore be preferred to those expressing consequentialist judgments because these judgments may be more reliable indicators of stable cooperative behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And recent theoretical work has demonstrated that -“cooperating without looking”—that is, without considering the costs and benefits of cooperation—is a subgame perfect equilibrium (Hoffman, Yoeli, &amp; Nowak, 2015). Therefore, expressing characteristically deontological judgments could constitute a behavior that enhances individual fitness in a cooperation market because these judgments are seen as reliable indicators of a specific valued behavior-cooperation.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hoffman et al (2015) present an evolutionary game theoretic analysis of an indefinitely repeated game where</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Here the analogy to effective versus ineffective giving is not clear…</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Player 1 can publicly ‘look’ to see the cost of cooperation,</li>
<li>Player 1 next chooses to cooperate or defect, and then<br />
</li>
<li>Player 2 chooses whether to continue repeating the above game, or end the relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide conditions under which ‘cooperating without looking’ (CWOL) is part of a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, and an evolutionarily stable equilibrium can involve a substantial rate of CWOL play.</p>
<p>However, the analogy to effective versus ineffective giving is not clear. Perhaps a connection could be made <em>if considering the charity effectiveness tended to provide a motivation to give less</em>, but this is not obviously the case. In general, an ‘excuse not to do something’ is not the same as a ‘choice to be effective’.</p>

<li>participants evaluate a response to survey question about how to select a charity (“If you were to donate, how would you select which charity to donate to?”).</li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathic: I would try to put myself in the shoes of people who are going through difficult situations, and donate to a charity that helped them.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>John was approached by a charity fundraiser and was asked whether he would be interested in donating to help Rokia, a 7-year-old girl from Mali, Africa who was desperately poor and faced the threat of severe hunger or even starvation. The charity fundraiser showed John a picture of Rokia (also presented to participants) and then asked John whether he would be interested in supporting her.
Across conditions, participants were presented with the general scenario and only the potential donor’s actions differed depending on the condition:</li>
</ol>
<p>Deliberation: “John thought that donating to help Rokia might not be the most cost-effective way to use his money and that maybe he should donate to a charity doing something more cost-effective instead. He asked the charity fundraiser about the relevant statistics of the program and since the data suggested this charity was the most cost-effective John donated to the charity.”
Empathy: “John was deeply moved by Rokia’s situation and about how terrible her situation must be for her. After hearing about her tragic story and imagining how his donation could help her John donated to the charity.”</p>
<p>Robustness checks for: gender, stake size</p>
<p>Background mechanism: donors’ failure to prioritize cost-effectiveness can be explained by signaling concerns, since people who favor deontological over consequentialist decisions are preferred as social partners (Everett et al., 2016),
Key findings: Across six studies, donors who deliberated were perceived as having worse moral character, were rated as less desirable as social partners, and were judged to be less guided by moral motives. On the other hand, those who deliberated were also seen as more reasonable and competent, and were judged to be more guided by pragmatic motives,
Thus, there may be reputational benefits associated with deliberating. However, since deliberators are less preferred as social partners the authors believe the overall effect one reputation is negative. They do not find any differences in trustworthiness. Exhibiting empathy before deliberating reduced most negative reputational effects. People how do not give at all are seen as the worst. Surprisingly, participants judge the empathy donors as more wastful.</p>

<p>Even if we accept the above evidence (that those who make consequentialist active choices in “sacrificial dilemmas” are seen as less trustworthy and less moral) this may not generalize to <em>effective giving</em>. Researching and selecting a more effective charity is closest to the ‘track switching’ scenario in these experiments, in which no substantial difference was observed, and even here it is a stretch. Choosing a more effective charity instead of a more local one (e.g., river blindess prevention in Africa versus local guide Dogs) would be hard to cast seen as taking an active step to <em>harm someone</em>.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>True, a local blind person may fail to get an additional (fraction of a) dog as a result of this choice. However, there is little sense in which “you funding his dog” would be seen as the status quo absent your intervention.</p>

<p>People may be reluctant<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> to consider the cost and benefits of the actions they are funding through their charitable donations (or they find this less appropriate/normal). This contrasts with a much greater willingness to consider these and other domains such as consumption, investment, and public policy. People also seem to avoid accessing/buying/seeing information (particular information that may be likely to feel compelled to give.)</p>

<p>For this to be considered a bias, the relevant individuals must intrinsically value the usefulness of their charitable activity at least to some extent. I.e., they must be Moral Utilitarians, at least in part, or for some of the time. However, they may consider it very costly or distasteful to actually do this evaluation, or it may
clash with other motivations and tendencies.</p>
<p>This aversion also must be distinguished from a lack of <em>ability</em> to do CBA in the charity domain; the latter would instead be considered a <a href="#quant-biases">quantitative bias</a>.</p>
<p>The reluctance to engage in this evaluation process may relate to the aforementioned<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> “taboo trade-offs”; if these tradeoffs are taboo, considering them may involve great emotional distress.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Berman2018"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> refer to the idea that “believing that charity is a subjective decision licenses individuals to donate in personally gratifying ways.” This perspective plausibly combines partial and conflicted Utililitarian preferences with the presence of moral licensing.</p>
As Berman et al note, the belief that <em>CBA is not a natural part of the charitable domain</em> may stem from the lack of direct feedback one gets from donating (in Economics terms, a “credence” good) relative to consumption and investment goods.

<p>Several papers<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> find that people are reluctant to pay for—or actively seek to avoid— certain information. However, these may reflect motives distinct from CBA, such as a self-serving bias.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered" number="">Evidence for “People rarely seek out effectiveness information and are reluctant to purchase it”</h4>
<!-- TODO - Cite: That survey-based study where few people say that they have
looked into the effectiveness information on the charities they donate
to -->
<p>In <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="null2011warm"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, in a final stage of her experiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subjects were given the option to spend USD 5 of their total gift to the
development charities in order to find out which of the three would
receive a matching rate of USD 3 (the other two would receive matching
rates of USD 1.50). Altruistic subjects whose donation was at least USD 20
and gave to all three charities, or whose total gift is greater than
USD 35 and gave to two charities, would find it profitable to purchase
the information. … (84%) met these criteria on gift size and number
of charities supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…only 40% of subjects were willing to give up a small portion of
their endowments in order to find out which charity would receive the
highest rate; the rest preferred to allocate their gifts without
knowing what they would be worth to the charities."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...These subjects who chose not to purchase the information
forfeited matching funds ranging from 30-150% of the value of their
unmatched gifts, with the median donor sacrificing matching funds
exactly equal to the value of her unmatched gift, a truly staggering
sum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Null attributes this failure to buy information either to subjects who “simply did not care about the potential to substitute into the charity with the highest matching rate”, perhaps driven by some form of simplistic warm glow motive, or to simple misunderstanding or fatigue (in an incentivized elicitation, she found some evidence of incomplete comprehension). To the extent this is <em>not</em> a misunderstanding, it might be seen as evidence of CBA aversion; participants did not want to purchase evidence that would require them to do calculations in this domain.</p>

<h4 number="8.1.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.4.1</span> Evidence for “People do not respond ‘efficiently’ to information about costs and benefits”</h4>
<p>Null (2011) ran a set of experiments at Kiwanis/Rotary clubs and with “professional subjects” (university administrators?) at the Berkeley X-lab; the former strictly involved allocations <em>among</em> charities, in the latter case what was not given away could be kept. For the main reported treatments, participants made a series of decisions under different incentives (mostly on the same page and thus simultaneously?). The “prize” was $100; in each session only one decision from one subject was chosen for actual payment/donations.</p>
<p>Many participants who choose to donate positive amounts to multiple charities in earlier (?stages) continue to donate to multiple charities when one charity is given a better match rate; they only “imperfectly substitute” (and some even substitute away from the now “lower-priced” charity). She attributes this to both risk aversion (diminishing utility in to each charity’s actual impact, along with uncertainty about this impact) as well to as a version of “warm glow” with a diminishing marginal benefit in the amount given to each charity.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> However, this could also be attributed to a simple failure to make these cost-benefit calculations (as she also found some evidence suggesting misunderstanding
of the nature of these incentives).</p>

<h4 number="8.1.4.2"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.4.2</span> Evidence for “people accept and value subjectivity in the charitable domain more so than for other choice domains”</h4>
<p><strong><em>Berman et al (2018)</em></strong> provide evidence from a series of five survey/vignette experiments; unlike those mentioned above, these (mostly) involve hypothetical choices among <em>multiple</em> causes. All experiments use standard subject pools (behavioral lab subjects or m-turkers) with reasonably large samples. All ask for hypothetical (Likert-scale) responses involving fictional charities, investments, and other scenariae; they mostly rely on between-subject responses, and their statistical analyses report reasonable tests on the relevant comparisons.</p>
<p>Their “Study 1: Perceived Subjectivity of Charity” found that, in rating statements such as “it is important that the ______ I choose reflects my personal tastes or values” and “It is more important to rely on objective measures rather than personal feelings when choosing ______ ... they found people agreed more with the <em>subjective/taste</em> approach when assigned a treatment where the blank was”Charity", relative to those assigned treatments involving medical treatments, investments, and cel phones. (But less than some other things like art, and similar to restaurants in some tests!)</p>
<p>Their “Study 2: Personal Feelings Versus Welfare Gains” presented participants with “Mary” and a pairing of fictional domestic (homelessness) and international (micronutrient) charities, presenting effectiveness information on both (clearly favoring the latter). The treatment-- which charity Mary felt an emotional connection to-- had a significant impact on the response to “Which charity should Mary donate to”, in the predicted direction. They were also asked: “Which option does the greatest good for the greatest number of people?”; here responses favored the international charity for both treatments; but even so, when Mary felt connected to local charity, participants favored donating there.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
Berman et al argue that their results demonstrate the acceptance of the suggestive preferences is somewhat attenuated by the "role of responsibility", but it's not clear what this term means or how this could be relevant to voluntary individual giving.
</div>
<p>In their “Study 3: Charity Versus Investment Choice”, subjects were assigned categories and fictional examples of either charities or investment, and presented domain categories and effectiveness information for each. Fewer participants in the charity treatment (relative to the investment treatment) chose to sort by effectiveness rating, and fewer chose the highest rated option.</p>
<p>In Study 4, they find that, in rating research departments for funding, participants pay more attention to charity effectiveness ratings when the are given the “role” of a “president of a local medical research center” rather than a donor. Similarly, in Study 5 participants assess someone who allocates funds to a research department; participants respond to the effectiveness of the department chosen more when rating the decision quality and altruism/selfishness of a “president…” than rating a “donor”.</p>
Overall, these suggest that, when considering charitable donations,
people tend to favor–or at least to accept–the use of subjective
preferences and personal ties, rather than objective information, and
they do so more than for more “standard” goods and choices. This is more
accepted for “donors” than for people with responsibility for others’
funds.

<p>However (as they do note), the effectiveness information
still has <em>some</em> (positive) effect on participants’ responses; it is not
ignored. Their experiments also do not analyze the <em>avoidance</em> of

    children recipients would also seem to be an effectiveness measure)

<p><em><span class="underline">Definitional issues and disambiguation</span></em></p>
<p>This needs to be distinguished from scope insensitivity. Note that if people are being analytical, they must <em>care</em> about scope in order to care about their impact, and thus (mistakenly) react to the perceived lower impact of donating when the needs are much greater.
PD arguments may also be used as vehicle for motivated reasoning, and thus not be an important driver in itself: E.g., I don’t want to donate so I focus on my impact being a share of the overwhelming need (which I might opportunistically define broadly) to conclude that helping is futile.</p>
<p>Note (unfold)…</p>

<div class="fold">
BG: My thought was that people who do not value saving lives (or are in general unwilling to contribute to it or oppose policies spending money on foreign aid for some other reason, e.g. prejudice) exercise a form of motivated reasoning to justify this (perhaps in a nonstandard way). They choose to reason according to the ‘proportional’ standard in order to conclude that it is not worth mdonating to these causes because ‘the scope of the problem is too large and they will never be completely solved’. I suggest that people apply this reasoning to problems specifically when they do not want to take action to address these problems. (In contrast, in domains where they do want to make a change, they may use a different, more marginal and 'consistent' sort of reasoning.) E.g., (to be stereotypical) imagine a MAGA person who wants to end foreign aid because "Africa will always have endless problems" but who wants to impose restrictions on abortion (even knowing millions of abortions will continue to occur) because "every unborn life matters.
</div>
<p>To operationalize this, we need to define what the numerator and denominator represent. For the numerator, an (EA) impact-driven individualist donor might consider of her <em>own</em> contribution (per dollar or overall) relative to the size of the need. In contrast, a more collectivist/team-reasoning/communitarian thinker might consider the impact of the <em>total</em> expected donation relative to the size of the need. We also need to better define the denominator; how do individuals lump together different groups/problems to define the overall scale of the need, and how sensitive is this to the fundraisers’ framing?
<em><span class="underline">Mechanisms</span></em></p>
<p>Fetherstonhaugh et al (1997) highlight “Weber’s law”: Humans are sensitive to proportional changes/proportional differences in stimuli (loudness, brightness, etc); thus we are less sensitive to small changes relative to a larger baseline. There is evidence this also holds in assessing losses of life. ... the “subjective value of saving the specified number of lives is greater for a smaller tragedy than for a larger one” .</p>
<p>Baron attributes PD to quantity confusion and classifies this as “contamination by an irrelevant factor”; more generally, this could be seen in terms of <em>innumeracy</em>.</p>
<p>This may lead to a lower willingness to contribute to a problem when the apparent scale (or “denominator”) of the problem is larger (e.g., more lives at risk), holding constant the benefit per dollar contributed (cost per life saved). The <em>perceived</em> scale of the problem may depend on how it is framed by fundraisers, charities, and the media. However, this may not be completely manipulable: e.g., massive global problems may not be easy to “frame down.”

increased sympathy towards the victims when one can help a large

<p>This effect represents a general departure from appropriate assessment of the marginal benefit (per cost) of a particular charity/intervention. Thus this is a general barrier to accurate assessment of effectiveness ergo a barrier to effective giving.</p>
<p>In addition, it might be argued that more effective interventions (e.g., targeting poor Africans versus US poverty) may tend to address problems that are inherently larger in scale and magnitude. These may be intrinsically harder to “frame down”, implying EG will suffer more from this bias.</p>

<p><br />

<blockquote>
<p>Studies 1 and 2 found that an intervention saving a fixed number of
lives was judged significantly more beneficial when fewer lives were at
risk overall. Study 3 found that respondents wanted the minimum number

potential victims than for a disease with a smaller number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PDE-ad was in part based on text from the homepage of a
well-known global charity organization focusing on poverty in
developing countries. Participants read about Polio and were told that
if receiving the expected amount of private donations, it would be
possible to vaccinate children so the death rate would decrease by
approximately 500 children per year. In the large reference-group
version, participants read that 60,000 children in Africa annually die
from Polio so the project had a potential rescue proportion of 0.83%.
In the small reference-group version, partici pants read that around
500 children in Botswana annually die from Polio so the project had a
potential rescue proportion of more than 99%.</p>
<p>...followed by eight questions about participants’ reactions towards
the advertisement. The suggested mediators (distress, sympathy,
perceived impact and perceived responsibility) were measured with two
questions each</p>
<p>...after reading and responding to the three ads, participants were
told that thanks to their participation, 10 Swedish Kronor (SEK)
$1.50 would be donated to charity. The participants were asked to
allocate the money between the three organizations by writing an
amount (0–10) after each ad and the sum had to be 10 SEK</p>
<p>...All participants read either one ad from the low end of the
effects (statistical victim, large reference-group, out-group victims)
plus two ads from the high end of the effects (identified victim,
small reference-group, in-group victims) or two ads from the low end
plus one ad from the high end.</p>
<p>[Results]</p>
<p>Participants who read the PDE-ad in the small reference-group version
had higher helping intentions (M = 3.77, SD = 1.64) than participants
who read the large reference-group version, M = 3.46, SD = 1.57;
t(430) = 2.01, p = .045. However, participants who read the small
reference-group version did not write that they would donate more
money if asked (Mean rank = 213.68) than participants who read the
large reference-group version (Mean rank = 218.31; Mann–Whitney U =
22720.50, Z = 0.40, p = .686). Despite this, participants who read the
small reference-group version allocated more money to the organization
distributing Polio- vaccines (M = 4.30 SEK, SD = 2.85) than the
participants who read the large reference-group version, M = 3.50 SEK,
SD = 2.87; t(430) = 2.91, p = .004. Although not perfectly consistent
between the different outcome variables, the results suggest that we
replicated the PDE.</p>

<p>S1: Questions about (hypothetical wtp for components of government
government health insurance. “[Denominator] people die from this
disease each year. Their average age is 60. How much are you willing to
pay to cover a treatment that will save the lives of [Numerator] of

10,000), all combinations presented to all participants.</p>
<p>S2: Set of causes, each gave wtp for a government program for a 5%
reduction in that cause of death and for saving 2,600 lives, also rating
prevalence and importance. He reports a very high correlation between
wtp by these two measures, an “insensitivity to quantity”, and both wtp
measures are higher when subjects report a higher prevalence (even
controlling for stated importance).</p>
<p><span class="underline">Evaluation of paper’s evidence</span>: This evidence appears
highly limited. There is some evidence that denominators matter when
they (arguably) should not, and participants show confusion between
proportions and absolute amounts. The second experiment is highly
cognitively demanding and participants have no strong incentive to “get
this right.” The first experiment has arguable confounds: e.g., one
might question the scientific credibility of the treatment that (claims
to) save only a small number of lives out of a very large population.
The evidence does not seem to offer much strength over and above the

be incomplete or unclear, especially for study two. In general, this is,
at its best, evidence of quantitative confusion which may go in either
direction in any given context.</p>
<p>It is also detached from the charity realm, considering the domain of
government expenditure and benefits that will accrue to the participant
him or herself. For this reason, I listed it is tangential evidence and
not charity specific evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PN was investigated by varying the supposed number of brak-
ing-related traffic fatalities each year as a within-subjects variable
and then obtain- ingjudgments of support for a new antilock brake
requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Experiment 1 manipulated respondents’ accountability [“…the
experimenter will ask you at this time to explain the reasoning behind
your decisions and to justify how you arrived at your recommendations”]
as a way of exploring whether PN responding is the result of careless or
heuristic processing. Extensive work with accountability manipulations
has shown them to be effective in debiasing… [other stuff]. …
when they expect to have to justify their reason- ing to others, should
also be revealing in terms of what they believe constitutes a
defensible, normative strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[also] a manipulation designed to highlight the salience of the
individual lives at risk … [a] description of a preventable, fatal
accident with named individuals…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>, par- ticipants read that the “Federal Transportation Board”
estimated annual fatalities due to driver error in the use of
conventional braking systems to be approximately 41,000 (“large
problem”) or 9,000 (“small problem”).<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Outcome measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“support-for-intervention”, 7-point scale</p></li>
<li><p>“Lives-to-save”</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is the minimum number of these (9,000/41,000) lives at risk … saved each year before you… require consumers &gt; to pay for anti-lock brakes”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treatments started with one size, then presented a “task force’s new
estimate” with the reverse.</p>

When assessing effectiveness in determining which charity to donate to (and how much), a utilitarian should be very sensitive to the scale of the impact (essentially the benefit per cost).

<li><strong>R</strong> is a free programming language which is mainly used for data analysis and statistics. It can be downloaded <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">here</a>. The popularity of R is growing in Economics Academia, largely due to the growth of Machine Learning techniques in R as well as the flexibility of the language itself.
R makes use of <strong>packages</strong> which are a collection of functions written in order to achieve specific tasks. Whilst R comes pre-installed with a variety of useful packages, it is often useful to install more, which can be done using the <em>install.packages</em> command.
<div class="marginnote">

<li><strong>RStudio</strong> is a programming environment and interface which helps facilitate a variety of tasks such as writing scripts using R (as well as other languages), and building/knitting these into various document formats. RStudio ‘Addins’ can also be extremely useful for things like tracking ‘todos’, adding citations, and formatting code.

<ul>
<li><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system which enables users to track changes and progress in coding projects or any files in general. It is particularly useful for collaborating on projects as it provides a useful way to show who has altered which files and when. Users are even able to clone a <em>repository</em> (a folder inside of a project which tracks all changes made) and make changes without affecting the original project. Git also provides a very simple way to keep changes to projects up to date across different operating systems such as Windows and Mac.

<div class="fold">
<ul>
<li><p>Git and Github are not the same thing … (explain)</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘commit’ does not actually change the files in the shared (remote) Github repo; you need to ‘push’ to do that</p></li>
<li><p>After ‘pulling’ from the remote repo, you may need to merge changes… (explain)</p></li>
<li><p>You can have several different ‘branches’ of the same Repo existing at the same time. When you switch to a new ‘branch’ the files you see on your computer will instantly and amazingly change to exactly the files in that branch. But don’t worry, the old branch is not lost.</p></li>
<li><p>… add some more</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A brief overview of key functions inside Git (assuming a remote Github repo) including commits, pushes &amp; pulls, forks &amp; branches and pull requests: (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<ul>
<li>A <strong>commit</strong> saves the changes made in the current document to the <strong>local</strong> repository. Specific changes to commit to the remote (online) repo must be specified. This process is made much easier using a program such as Github Desktop rather than the Git code itself (although they do the same thing, and the latter is more flexible).</li>
<li>A <strong>push</strong>, pushes all local commits to the online version of this repository, essentially updating the online version of the files, to the version which is stored locally on your device.</li>
<li>A <strong>pull</strong>, is used to pull the changes made to the online repository, into the local repository. Thus making the local repository up to date with the remote/online repository.</li>
<li>Creating a <strong>branch</strong> allows you to create a separate version of a repository and make changes to this without affecting the master/original repository.</li>
<li>A <strong>pull request</strong> then allows you to pull the changes made in a branch over to the master repository, in order to merge the work.</li>
<li>As noted, <strong>Github Desktop</strong> provides a user interface for a more simple and intuitive way to use Git. There are a variety of other interfaces.
<ul>
<li>Github can also be integrated into RStudio and into many other tools, such as the Atom text editor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repos that are stored on Github can be accessed via a browser at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. The Github website itself provides a wide variety of tools.</li>

<h2 number="13.4"><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Markdown and Bookdown</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Markdown</strong> is a popular set of formats (really a ‘syntax for specifying output’) for generating and authoring documents. The Rmarkdown format (rmarkdown package) is one flavor of Markdown that works with R to enable ‘dynamic documents’ involving text, data-analysis, and other elements. It can then export your work to a variety of outputs such as html, pdf and word documents. As well as this it can also be used to create webpages, such as the one you are currently reading. The power of Markdown files comes from the way that they are able include/embed code as well as data and tables, which is useful for writing reproducible research and creating websites.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Bookdown</strong> package was built on the Rmarkdown package, but it adds many features to enable larger and more structured output, particularly ‘web books’ and web sites. As we use it, this these books combine multiple Rmarkdown files, with each such ‘Rmd’ file becoming its own HTML page.</p></li>

<!-- Could do with rewording -->
<p>The Markdown format offers a simple plain-text notation for specifying the elements of documents, reports, web sites, etc. (It is much simpler and easier to read than html, latex, etc.) It is widely used by programmers, on comment boards/forums, and throughout the internet. For example, GitHub.com automatically renders markdown code, particularly in <code>readme.md</code> files.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Actually there are several varieties of markdown, but they mainly share key elements.</p>
</div>
<p>Markdown documents are usually saved as plain text files with the extension <code>.md</code>, e.g., <code>report.md</code>. These allow for an easy way to create a variety of outputs, particularly reports and text-focused web pages. The markdown format is <em>converted</em> into other formats (html, latex, etc.) with a variety of tools, particularly something called Pandoc.</p>
<p>In the R (statistically focused) language there are tools such as <code>knitR</code> that allow R users to produce reports combining text, statistical output, and interactive content. These are generally written in “R-markdown” documents, saved as <code>.Rmd</code> rather than <code>.md</code> files. The R-studio interface, and several “add-ins”, also help facilitate this. This interface is very useful; in fact, it may be convenient to build web books and other content using this even if you are not planning to extensively integrate R code and data. (As in the present book, although I’m hoping to build this in).</p>
<p>Using R-markdown and Knitr (and other tools and add-ins like ‘Bookdown’) content from multiple sources can easily be embedded into these documents allowing users to easily display objects such as plots or regression output.</p>

<p>Hashtags/pound signs (<code>#</code>) specify headers and subheaders, e.g., this third-level subsection header was created with the code:</p>
<p><code>### Some simple markdown rules {#simple-md-rules}</code></p>
<p>Where the bit in the curly braces allows us to link-back with the code <code>[link back text whatever](#simple-md-rules)</code> … rendering as <a href="#simple-md-rules">link back text whatever</a>.</p>
<p>Other key features are ordered lists and unordered lists:</p>
<pre><code>- unordered first entry
- unordered second entry
     - subelement of second entry</code></pre>
<p>While basic markdown has a limited set of rules, there are many more formatting and content options for documents produced in (R)-Markdown, far too many to detail here. These may combine markdown code, html code, latex code, and more. The following cheatsheets are very useful for writing (R)-markdown documents:</p>
<p>Markdown documents allow for an easy way to write reports. Content from multiple sources can easily be embedded into these documents allowing users to easily display objects such as plots or tables of data.</p>

<p>Code chunks provide an easy way to embed code into your R Markdown files. The code language is not just limited to R either, as other languages can be used. This means that there is a wide variety of content which can be displayed in a chunk. Such as tables of data:</p>
<pre><code>##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa</code></pre>
<p>Code chunks are defined by wrapping text inside <code>```  ```</code>. The above example was coded using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1"></a><span class="bn">```{r}</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2"></a><span class="bn">head(iris)</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3"></a><span class="bn">```</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<!-- ````markdown ```
```` -->
<p>Options can be specified inside of the curly brackets {}

<h3 number="13.6.3"><span class="header-section-number">13.6.3</span> Inline code</h3>
<p>Inline code is a quick and easy way to put snippets of R code. As an alternative to using code chunks, R code can simply be placed inside of <code>`r `</code>. For example, this can be used as an easy way to insert the value of a variable into a paragraph without inserting a chunk.</p>
</div>
<div id="latexmaths" class="section level3" number="13.6.4">
<h3 number="13.6.4"><span class="header-section-number">13.6.4</span> Latex/maths</h3>
<p>R Markdown also can make use of the LaTeX document preparation system, which is popular for writing technical documents with mathematical content. This allows us to publish documents which include equations such as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1 +\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_kx_k+u\]</span></p>
<p>Which is written using <code>$$y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1 +\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_kx_k+u.$$</code>. Using <code>$$</code> means that the equation will be centered on the page. Alternatively <code>$</code> can be used in the same way, without the centering.

For these projects, styles are contained in <a href="support/tufte_plus.css">support/tufte_plus.css</a>. To use a defined style, the user can specify options at the start of a chunk, or using a HTML wrapper as show below for margin notes.</p>

<div class = 'marginnote'>
<p>More on creating styles <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html">here</a>.
There are 3 main custom styles which are used throughout the projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘Notes’</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
Formatted ‘Notes’ have been defined in this work which allow text to be placed in coloured blocks such as this one. To use this note style, <code>{block2, type ='note'}</code> can be specified at the start of the block, or a HTML wrapper can be used. This assigns the .note formatting from the tufte_plus.css file to the chunk.
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Margin notes</strong>
Margin notes are used throughout these projects as a way of displaying information in an organised and aesthetically pleasing way. To add a margin note, text is placed inside the following HTML wrapper:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 78db1096bf2899c13e2248dc8728ad0dc55e7fdc</li>
</ul>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>The margin notes used in this project are inspired by the Tufte handout style developed by American statistician Edward Tufte.</p>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;marginnote&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2"></a>Your margin note goes here.</span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3"></a><span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or margin notes can be added by using chunk options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Folding boxes</strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="fold">
Folding boxes also provide a useful way to incorporate content without cluttering the page. Similarly to the ‘notes’ the folding boxes are defined in tufte_plus.css and called by specifying <code>{block2, type='fold'}</code> at the start of a chunk, or using a HTML wrapper.

<div id="adding-referencescitations" class="section level3" number="13.6.8">
<h3 number="13.6.8"><span class="header-section-number">13.6.8</span> Adding references/citations</h3>
<p>As with any academic work, it is always important to reference sourced material. Across these projects the following software is used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Pandoc provides a way to generate formatted references as well as a bibliography in Markdown.</p>
<p>(This is done through Pandoc tools.)</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Oska, are you sure about this?</p>
</div>
<p>The bibliography file to be sourced is specified within ‘YAML’ content, which guides the processing of these documents. (YAML content is generally enclosed with a three-dash <code>---</code> break at top and bottom.)</p>
<p>I generally specify the bibliography source in the YAML at the top of the .Rmd file, or for Bookdown project,s in the the YAML content in index.Rmd. (Y</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Oska"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> – we should try to ecplain this yaml stuff a bit better.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>BibTeX</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The BibTeX format refers to a stylized file format which is used predomoninantly for lists of references, mainly and originally for working with latex.. BibTeX bibliographies use the .bib extension. For example the bibliography for this project is <a href="support/giving_keywords.bib">giving_keywords.bib</a>. For more information on BibTeX see <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">here</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Citr package (addin) for RStudio</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Citr package provides functions to search Zotero and BibTeX libraries in order to insert references into Markdown files. Citr also features a plugin for RStudio which makes the referencing process even easier. Instructions for download, as well as a demonstration of the Rstudio plugin are provided <a href="https://github.com/crsh/citr/blob/master/README.md">here.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zotero</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Zotero is a free open source reference manager, which enables users to sync their library of references across multiple devices. Similarly to other reference managers, Zotero offers plugins for popular browsers such as Chrome and Safari. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">Download Zotero</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better BibTeX for Zotero</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Better BibTeX for Zotero is a add-on for Zotero. Among other things it allows the Zotero library to be exported from Zotero for use in Markdown. Installation instructions are provided <a href="http://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/">here.</a></p>
<p>I currently (25 Apr 2020) am having Zotero automatically maintain/output the key .bib file to a dropbox folder. Each project has code to routinely download this file with a command such as</p>
<p><code>download.file(url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/3i8bjrgo8u08v5w/reinstein_bibtex.bib?raw=1", destfile = "reinstein_bibtex.bib")</code></p>

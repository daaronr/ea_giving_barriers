# Barriers: Awareness, consideration, and distance {#aware-distance}


EA: Typically,  the most effective (humanitarian) charity will go from wealthy countries in the "North"  to poor countries in the "South".   the large social cultural geographic distance is an important barrier to giving,  and a reason why people prefer to give locally. However,  technology continues to reduce these barriers (see, e.g., EA Global and their new web-enabled tools).

## Distance - Spatial/Physical, Social/Cultural: parochial altruism/ingroup bias,  interpersonal and identity e.g., race, gender, age, etc

## Distance: Experiential, Informational, Emotional/Affective

## Distance -  Temporal (future problems and people), Hypothetical (probability to happen)

## Availability heuristic and media (also see 'biases')


<!-- Consistent problems aren't as noticable (reflected in media also) - availability heuristic [separate from 'repeated exposure makes it more relevant ... opposite implication] -->

## Description and relevance to Effective Giving

Typically, the most effective charities operate in developing countries, with all but one of Give Well's top charities supporting people in sub-Saharan Africa [@TopCharities]. Moreover, people in wealthy developed countries are more likely to be in a position to give a significant amount [@macaskillDoingGoodBetter2015]. However, The large, social,  cultural geographic distance between those in developed countries and those in developing countries may be an important barrier to giving  and a reason why people prefer to give locally. 

@loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007 propose a relationship between sympathy and helping behaviour, drawing on experimental findings from Psychology and Economics. This in turn relates to the dual system model (as discussed by @kahnemanThinkingFastSlow2011). This model distinguishes between System 1, which makes initial judgements (using 'affective cognition'); these are monitored by a more 'deliberative cognition' System 2 [@morewedge2010associative].(This model has been subjected to some criticism, @evans2013dual discuss the debate around dual system theories)

<!-- @LA: this psychological model is widely known but also widely criticised model; we need to either mention it briefly with a link to some papers surveying it, or discuss it more carefully. Perhaps you can draw (and quote) some language from my paper with Robin Bergh, or others in this literature -->

## Distance - Spatial/Physical, Social/Cultural: parochial altruism/ingroup bias,  interpersonal and identity e.g., race, gender, age, etc

Consider: 

- What is the evidence that we are less empathetic or less generous to those far from us along these margins?

- What is the evidence that this is manifested in our actions and choices (political, professional, etc)?

-  What is the evidence that this is manifested in our charitable giving? 

Parochialism may pose a significant barrier to effective giving. Parochialism, as defined by @baron2011heuristics is the mental process of making a distinction between in-groups and out-groups, where people feel a greater connection with their own groups and weigh their welfare more heavily.

There is some evidence for this in charitable contexts. In a laboratory experiment, @chenGroupIdentitySocial2009 found that when matched with an in-group member, people were significantly more likely to show charitable concern, shown through their allocation of tokens. @Sudhir2016a suggest that categorizing others as in-group members (along lines such as race, gender and age) increases the sense of responsibility and level of emotion felt, resulting in higher levels of sympathy and consequently a stronger urge to help. They examined this effect by randomizing advertising content in a large scale experiment with charitable mailings in India. When the woman on a flyer advertising the charity in question was from the in-group (in this case a Hindu woman in India, compared to a Christian woman in the out-group), they found a higher rate of donation and greater amounts raised. They suggest that the charity "more than doubles donation dollars by recognizing the identified victim sympathy bias in making its appeals". 

## Distance: Experiential, Informational, Emotional/Affective

## Distance -  Temporal (future problems and people), Hypothetical (probability to happen)

<div class="marginnote">
This is particularly relevant to causes and charities dealing with the medium-term and long-term future.
</div>

## Availability heuristic and media (also see 'biases')

Rare events such as natural disasters are particularly vivid and salient, and the availability bias suggests that people will overestimate the probability and value of events if they come to mind more easily [@tversky1973availability]. For example, people might overestimate the probability of airplane crashes due to their salience. 

@loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007 argue that vividness is also one of the key determinants of sympathy, and one of the most important demonstrations of this is the identifiable victim effect. Their research suggests that victims who are 'determined' received higher levels of aid compared with indeterminate victims, as without identifying them people struggle to empathise, and are as a result less likely to help [@Small2003a]. 

<div class="marginnote">
 This effect is discussed further under the ['statistical/identifiable victims'](#statvictims) quantitative bias.

@epsteinCrisisMentalitySSIR2006 concluded that natural disasters received a level of donations that was significantly out of proportion to the damage the disasters caused, while other long-term, persistent problems such as AIDS and malaria got much less attention, and consequently much less funding. For example, he discusses the difference in donation rates at the time (2006) between victims of Hurricane Katrina and victims of AIDS, with private donors giving 1,839 dollars per person to those affected by Katrina, and only 10 dollars per person diagnosed with AIDS. He also argued that the huge donations to causes like Hurricane Katrina had the effect of significantly reducing donations to some other charities, although this idea of 'expenditure substitution' is hard to measure and is still largely unresolved. See previous section (['Are characteristic in competition](#substitution))

Even when it comes to relief from the government, @eisenseeNewsFloodsNews2007 suggest that the level of U.S. relief for natural disasters depended on whether the disaster had happened while other widely covered events were also occurring. 

Using data on natural disasters from the Emergency Disaster Database (EM-DAT), and disaster responses from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), they explored the relationship between news coverage and relief for natural disasters. To examine whether news had a causal effect on relief, they used two instrumental variables. These variables served the purpose of constructing “meaningful and operational measures of the availability of newsworthy material”. First, they used ‘news pressure’, by measuring the median number of minutes news broadcasts devoted to the top three news stories of the day. Secondly, they used the Olympics, chosen as a large media event that isn’t directly related to politics. 

They concluded that U.S. disaster relief decisions were dependent on “the availability of other newsworthy material at the time of the disaster”. Their explanation of this effect is that “relief decisions are driven by news coverage of disasters and that this news coverage is crowded out by other newsworthy material”. This potentially poses an issue for effective giving, as the authors suggest that the levels of relief shouldn’t be driven by factors that are not related to the effectiveness of the relief.

## Reference dependence 

The issue of the arguably disproportionate attention that natural disasters receive has been previously explored. @epsteinCrisisMentalitySSIR2006 disccuses the high levels of support that natural disasters get. He drew on the work of @spenceMismatchingMoneyNeed2006, who reported that there was little relationship between the degree of need and the level of donations. This was illustrated by the private donations (at the time - 2006) of USD 1839 per person impacted by Hurricane Katrina, and USD 10 per person impacted by AIDS. @small2010reference posed potential questions that this might raise: 

> Although the response to dramatic events showcases a great human capacity for caring, the relative neglect of ongoing suffering reveals an equal albeit less attractive capacity for indifference. Can we make sense of this duality? Why do chronic conditions fail to move us even though they do so much harm?

@Sudhir2016a and @small2010reference have both suggested that reference dependence could provide an explanation for this issue, drawing on the work of @kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979. Reference dependence is the notion that people don't value absolute amounts, but instead view gains and losses relative to a reference point [@kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979; @tverskyLossAversionRiskless1991]. 

Studies from @small2010reference analyze this effect beyond the utility of the individual, evaluating reference dependence in the context of others' utility. She predicts that because sympathy could be based on change, rather than on a state, then people who have experienced a loss will induce greater levels of sympathy than those who have chronic issues. @small2010reference summarizes the move from analyzing reference dependence for one's own self, to analyzing reference dependence when viewing the circumstances of others, as follows:

> Although the reference dependence modeled in prospect theory was conceived to explain the value of outcomes for the self, this research suggests that feelings and behavior with respect to the outcomes of others similarly responds to changes in welfare, not just absolute states. The studies provide insight into how the hardships of others appeal to our emotions. Bearing reference dependence in mind, the government, media and humanitarian agencies can better appeal to sympathy by shifting the focus of attention away from stats of need and instead to losses relative to a reference point. 

She also suggests that the high levels of sympathy and donations seen with natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, and the relative lack of sympathy for AIDS and malaria, are consistent with this idea.

The first study from @small2010reference examined whether people feel more sympathy for those who have had a negative change, by asking participants to rate their sympathy for people with health conditions that were described as either chronic or recent onset. She found that sympathy was significantly greater in the loss victims than the constant state victims, which she argued was the first evidence that sympathy may be greater in cases that involve a clear loss than for equivalent cases that involve a chronic misfortune. 

Her second study examined how this idea translated from emotion into actual decision making, using a dictator game. It found that allocators in the dictator game gave more money, and felt greater sympathy, to recipients who had recently lost than to those recipients who stayed constant. This led her to conclude that “prosocial behaviour is not simply a function of others’ states, but additionally responds to whether that state is chronic or changed”.

In a study from @Sudhir2016a, where they randomized charitable marketing content (described above), they also found evidence for sympathy being driven by reference dependency. They found that when victims were labelled as currently destitute, having been well-off before, this generated 50% more donors, and average donations per mailing increased by 33%. This is relative to advertisements depicting someone also described as destitute, but with an undescribed past. They concluded that this supported their hypothesis that those in chronic poverty are likely to get less sympathy than those who have suffered a change. 

These reference dependence effects may only be significant when the target is an identified victim. In another study from @small2010reference, she examined whether the affective quality of the victim moderates the reference dependence effect. She found, consistent with her other studies, that identified *loss* victims elicited more sympathy than identified *constant-state* victims. However, when this effect was examined with statistical victims, the effect was reversed, with the constant state victims getting more sympathy than the loss victims. Small suggests that this could be because when judgements are less emotion-based, as in the evaluation of statistical victims, people are more likely to account for the duration of the hardship. She evaluated the significance of this result as follows: 

> “This finding lends support to the key theoretical claim that reference-dependent aid judgements are driven by emotion-based thought; when the victim description is unemotional, the effect does not persist”



<div class="marginnote">
Here we should distinguish individual's *own* response to shocks from their sympathetic/empathetic and other-regarding-response to learning about *others'* shocks. I would also distinguish reference points a bit more carefully; there are all sorts of effects involving reference points.

<!-- @LS -it's improving but lets focus more on the *evidence* for these things. It will help to look at the previous literature review and synthesis work on these (see section 2.2 for a start). We can even incorporate material from this work, carefully citing it

# Barriers: Awareness, consideration, and distance {#aware-distance}

<!-- ?cuddy\_ea\_2007 (Sudhir ea, \'16) -->


- Distance - Spatial/Physical: parochial altruism/ingroup bias

- Distance - Temporal (future problems and people)

- Distance - Social/Cultural (interpersonal and identity e.g., race, gender, age, etc)

- Distance - Hypothetical (probability to happen)

- Distance - Emotional (Small's paper)

- Consistent problems aren't in the news

- Social/geographic distance attenuates empathy (and other motivators), aka, parochialism[^17]

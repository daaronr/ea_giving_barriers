## Description and relevance to Effective Giving

Typically, the most effective charities operate in developing countries, with all but one of Give Well's top charities supporting people in sub-Saharan Africa [@TopCharities]. Moreover, people in wealthy developed countries are more likely to be in a position to give a significant amount [@macaskillDoingGoodBetter2015]. However, The large, social,  cultural geographic distance between those in developed countries and those in developing countries may be an important barrier to giving  and a reason why people prefer to give locally. 

@loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007 propose a relationship between sympathy and helping behaviour, drawing on experimental findings from Psychology and Economics. This in turn relates to the dual system model (as discussed by @kahnemanThinkingFastSlow2011). This model distinguishes between System 1, which makes initial judgements (using 'affective cognition'); these are monitored by a more 'deliberative cognition' System 2 [@morewedge2010associative].(This model has been subjected to some criticism, @evans2013dual discuss the debate around dual system theories)

<!-- @LA: this psychological model is widely known but also widely criticised model; we need to either mention it briefly with a link to some papers surveying it, or discuss it more carefully. Perhaps you can draw (and quote) some language from my paper with Robin Bergh, or others in this literature -->

## Theoretical and conceptual underpinning

Construal theory,  psychological distance,  moral distance/moral circles

## Distance - Spatial/Physical, Social/Cultural: parochial altruism/ingroup bias,  interpersonal and identity e.g., race, gender, age, etc

Consider: 

- What is the evidence that we are less empathetic or less generous to those far from us along these margins?

- What is the evidence that this is manifested in our actions and choices (political, professional, etc)?

-  What is the evidence that this is manifested in our charitable giving? 

Parochialism may pose a significant barrier to effective giving. Parochialism, as defined by @baron2011heuristics is the mental process of making a distinction between in-groups and out-groups, where people feel a greater connection with their own groups and weigh their welfare more heavily.

There is some evidence for this in charitable contexts. In a laboratory experiment, @chenGroupIdentitySocial2009 found that when matched with an in-group member, people were significantly more likely to show charitable concern, shown through their allocation of tokens. @Sudhir2016a suggest that categorizing others as in-group members (along lines such as race, gender and age) increases the sense of responsibility and level of emotion felt, resulting in higher levels of sympathy and consequently a stronger urge to help. They examined this effect by randomizing advertising content in a large scale experiment with charitable mailings in India. When the woman on a flyer advertising the charity in question was from the in-group (in this case a Hindu woman in India, compared to a Christian woman in the out-group), they found a higher rate of donation and greater amounts raised. They suggest that the charity "more than doubles donation dollars by recognizing the identified victim sympathy bias in making its appeals". 

## Distance: Experiential, Informational, Emotional/Affective

## Distance -  Temporal (future problems and people), Hypothetical (probability to happen)

<div class="marginnote">
This is particularly relevant to causes and charities dealing with the medium-term and long-term future.
</div>

## Availability heuristic and media (also see 'biases')

Rare events such as natural disasters are particularly vivid and salient, and the availability bias suggests that people will overestimate the probability and value of events if they come to mind more easily [@tversky1973availability]. For example, people might overestimate the probability of airplane crashes due to their salience. 

@loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007 argue that vividness is also one of the key determinants of sympathy, and one of the most important demonstrations of this is the identifiable victim effect. Their research suggests that victims who are 'determined' received higher levels of aid compared with indeterminate victims, as without identifying them people struggle to empathise, and are as a result less likely to help [@Small2003a]. 

<div class="marginnote">
 This effect is discussed further under the ['statistical/identifiable victims'](#statvictims) quantitative bias.

@epsteinCrisisMentalitySSIR2006 concluded that natural disasters received a level of donations that was significantly out of proportion to the damage the disasters caused, while other long-term, persistent problems such as AIDS and malaria got much less attention, and consequently much less funding. For example, he discusses the difference in donation rates at the time (2006) between victims of Hurricane Katrina and victims of AIDS, with private donors giving 1,839 dollars per person to those affected by Katrina, and only 10 dollars per person diagnosed with AIDS. He also argued that the huge donations to causes like Hurricane Katrina had the effect of significantly reducing donations to some other charities, although this idea of 'expenditure substitution' is hard to measure and is still largely unresolved. See previous section (['Are characteristic in competition](#substitution))

Even when it comes to relief from the government, @eisenseeNewsFloodsNews2007 suggest that the level of U.S. relief for natural disasters depended on whether the disaster had happened while other widely covered events were also occurring. 

Using data on natural disasters from the Emergency Disaster Database (EM-DAT), and disaster responses from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), they explored the relationship between news coverage and relief for natural disasters. To examine whether news had a causal effect on relief, they used two instrumental variables. These variables served the purpose of constructing “meaningful and operational measures of the availability of newsworthy material”. First, they used ‘news pressure’, by measuring the median number of minutes news broadcasts devoted to the top three news stories of the day. Secondly, they used the Olympics, chosen as a large media event that isn’t directly related to politics. 

They concluded that U.S. disaster relief decisions were dependent on “the availability of other newsworthy material at the time of the disaster”. Their explanation of this effect is that “relief decisions are driven by news coverage of disasters and that this news coverage is crowded out by other newsworthy material”. This potentially poses an issue for effective giving, as the authors suggest that the levels of relief shouldn’t be driven by factors that are not related to the effectiveness of the relief.

They use a very interesting methodology; we might describe it a bit more.</div>

## Reference points 

It is argued that persistent problems can be less noticeable than rare events such as natural and man-made disasters. These persistent issues could then be inherently less present in donors' minds, and less reported in the media. @macaskillDoingGoodBetter2015 expressed this as follows.

> when a disaster strikes, the emotional centres of our brain flair up: we think - emergency! We forget there is an emergency happening all the time because we've grown accustomed to everyday emergencies like disease and poverty and oppression.  

This is related to the potential importance of 'Newness' as a determinant of sympathy. In their review of the literature on adaption, @frederick199916 suggest that people can be adaptive in dealing with negative shocks. 

<div class="marginnote">
Here we should distinguish individual's *own* response to shocks from their sympathetic/empathetic and other-regarding-response to learning about *others'* shocks. I would also distinguish reference points a bit more carefully; there are all sorts of effects involving reference points.
</div>

This attachment to reference points has been demonstrated by @Sudhir2016a. Their study suggested that people who are chronically poor or ill can get significantly less sympathy, and consequently donations, than people who have been effected by a change, such as falling into poverty at an old age. @loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007 argue that "of all the nonnormative factors that influence sympathy, perhaps novelty is the most profound and important for public policy". 

Issues such as AIDS, malaria and poverty are long-term issues, persistent over time, and when compared to the shock of a natural disaster, the potential problem that adaption can pose can be seen. According to [@macaskillDoingGoodBetter2015], people have gradually adapted to some extent to these problems, reducing the level of sympathy they feel and consequently lowering their desire to take action.

<!-- @LS -it's improving but lets focus more on the *evidence* for these things. It will help to look at the previous literature review and synthesis work on these (see section 2.2 for a start). We can even incorporate material from this work, carefully citing it

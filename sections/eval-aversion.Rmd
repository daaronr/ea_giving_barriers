## General relevance to effective giving 

For people to choose one product over another on the basis of some characteristic (e.g., safety, taste, or durability), they presumably must be *aware* of these differences before purchasing. Economists note [ref] the difficulty of investing in producing, marketing and selling high-quality products and services when consumers have difficulty distinguishing these products from inferior ones.  This is especially difficult when the quality of a product is not known before purchase (an 'Experience good'^[ref]^ such as a ticket to a particular stage show), or when it is not known until a long time later, if at all (a 'credence good' such as a health remedy or investment advice.) 

<div class="marginnote">
Insert abundant references here to asymmetric information, fly-by-night competition, and experience and creedence goods, product reviews, regulation, advertising as a signal, etc.
</div>

\

Considering a charitable donation as a product purchased by the donor, it seems to  fall into the latter category^[ref to authors making this point]^. If donors value their 'marginal impact on outcomes' as discussed in our earlier [definitions of impact](#def-impact), they may need to do extensive research (or at least know about and visit web sites such as [GiveWell](http://givewell.org) and [ImpactMatters](http://impactmatters.org)) to have some estimate of the value-for-money they are getting.
 
<div class="marginnote">
Donors may also be uncertain about other benefits they main gain from each donation such as 'gratitude and long-term sense of fulfillment'.
</div>

\

A typical charitable donor, particularly one who donates towards a geographically-distant intervention, will never directly see or experience the consequences of her donation. 
 
Thus, for people to systematically choose to donate to the most effective charities, presumably...

1. They must understand and value the idea of effectiveness.

2. They must either:

- a. know how effective charities are relative to one another,
- b. have reliable information on this presented to them by the charities (or other entities),
- c. or they must want to and find it appropriate to seek information on this, and be able to obtain reliable information.

3. (For b or c to have the desired effect...) The act of learning about effectiveness must not substantially decrease their willingness to donate.

\
In this section we consider the evidence for 

- I. People's aversion/willingness (or sense that it is appropriate/inappropriate) to evaluate effectiveness in a charitable giving context 

- II. The impact of being presented with (or actively pursuing) effectiveness information (which is naturally *analytical* information) on generosity and the willingness to donate


<div class="marginnote">

Effectiveness information may also affect how donors perceive the *social signaling* value of their donation. We return to this in the [signaling and social pressures...](#social) section.

</div>
 
\





Further 'grant-worthy' motivation (unfold).

```{block2,  type='fold'}

As noted above, scientific evidence suggesting that organizations’ “cost per outcome” differs substantially, perhaps by a factor of 1000 or more [@jamisonDeceiveNotDeceive2008]. This has motivated an increasing focus on charity effectiveness, spearheaded by initiatives from the Rockefeller and Gates foundations. Furthermore, organizations like [GiveWell](http://givewell.org) now provide direct ratings on the basis of  per-dollar impact (e.g., cost per life saved), and are reaching out to larger audiences. This approach might boost giving, by leveraging donors’ preferences for contributions “to be put to good use”—i.e., for direct interventions. 

E.g., In @Aknin2013  participants reported greater happiness when the impact of their contribution was highlighted. [@vaniwaardenCharitiesHowImportant2009; @Aknin2013]. 

However, while we have rigorous evidence on what works and doesn’t work in anti-poverty and health interventions (acknowledged by the [2019 Economics Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2019/press-release/)), we actually know very little about how potential donors react to this impact information! However, we actually know very little about how potential donors react to this impact information!

## General cost-benefit analysis (CBA)-aversion or reluctance {#cba-aversion}

<div class="marginnote">
This is hard to label: 'aversion' may be the wrong word: people may finding it less appropriate/normal/virtuous to do CBA in a charitable context, or it may naturally not occur to them to do it.
</div>

<!-- integrate in 'CBA_Nick.Rmd' -->

### Description

People may be reluctant^\*^ to consider the cost and benefits of the actions they are funding through their charitable donations (or they find this less appropriate/normal). This contrasts with a much greater willingness to consider these and other domains such as consumption, investment, and public policy. People also seem to avoid accessing/buying/seeing information (particular information that may be likely to feel compelled to give.)
  
<div class="marginnote">
How is this reluctance observed/manifested?
</div>

### Theoretical/conceptual discussion

For this to be considered a bias, the relevant individuals must intrinsically value the usefulness of their charitable activity at least to some extent. I.e., they must be Moral Utilitarians, at least in part, or for some of the time. However, they may consider it very costly or distasteful to actually do this evaluation, or it may clash with other motivations and tendencies.

This aversion also must be distinguished from a lack of *ability* to do CBA in the charity domain; the latter would instead be considered a  [quantitative bias](#quant-biases).

The reluctance to engage in this evaluation process may relate to the aforementioned <!-- where? --> "taboo trade-offs"; if these tradeoffs are taboo, considering them may involve great emotional distress.

[@Berman2018] refer to the idea that "believing that charity is a subjective decision licenses individuals to donate in personally gratifying ways." This perspective plausibly combines partial and conflicted Utililitarian preferences with the presence of moral licensing.

As @Berman2018 note, the belief that *CBA is not a natural part of the charitable domain* may stem from the lack of direct feedback one gets from donating (in Economics terms, a "credence" good) relative to consumption and investment goods. 

<div class="marginnote">
(they cite: Imas paper?)
</div>

Several papers^citation needed^ find that people are reluctant to pay for---or actively seek to avoid--- certain information. However, these may reflect motives distinct from CBA, such as a self-serving bias.  

<div class="marginnote">
On the other hand ...  a majority ranked effectiveness [how highly?] as a crucial criterion to select a charity and reported greater happiness when the impact of their contribution was highlighted. [@Aknin2013; @vaniwaardenCharitiesHowImportant2009]
</div>

#### Psychological theory behind CBA {-}

This CBA discomfort brings together several overlapping theoretical
frameworks:

-   Fiske's Relational Theory (@fiskeFourElementaryForms1992; also see @aggarwal2004effects), which proposes four basic types of social relationships: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing. For more here, see @heyman2004effort on social vs economic markets. 

-   Taboo Tradeoffs & Protected Values: to the extent that CBA requires making taboo tradeoffs that clash with protected values, people may be reticent to engage in CBA for prosocial purposes. 

-   Distorted Altruists as the existing dominant view (contrast) c.f., @loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007; @slovicPsychicNumbingGenocide2007 \-- people care about welfare maximization, **but without clear information to make comparisons**, they rely on their feelings to guide choice (@loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007; @slovicPsychicNumbingGenocide2007). @Berman2018 build on this. 

<div class="marginnote">
We distinguish CBA opposition from the inability to conduct CBA. The former is treated here while the latter involves a series of [quantitative biases discussed later](#quant-biases).
</div>

#### Relevance to Effective Giving (restated in fold) {-}

```{block2,  type='fold'}

If *determining which charity is effective* requires CBA people may avoid doing so. If effective charities *force* people to consider CBA then people may avoid these charities in order to avoid having to do these evaluations.

 
Stated more broadly, effective giving is predicated on conducting CBA for programs and organizations. To the extent that people are uncomfortable with CBA in the charitable domain, they will be uncomfortable with giving effectively.

```


### Evidence surrounding CBA {#cba-evidence}

#### Evidence for claim: "People sometimes actively avoid information about charity effectiveness that would motivate doing a CBA..." {-#avoid_info_CBA}

**[@Fong2011]** run dictator game experiments involving payments to real-life welfare recipients living in 178 public housing in Pittsburgh;  each subject is matched with a particular recipient  of their potential donation. In their *"Choice treatment",* a subject can choose to pay \$1 to learn about a recipient's drug use or disability, information meant to suggest the deservingness of the recipient. "We find that a third of the dictators are willing to pay money to learn more about their recipient. Dictators who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less-preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers." 

But this needs to be interpreted carefully:  *those who decide not to buy information appear less generous than the average*!

<div class="marginnote">
[@dellavigna2012testing] provide evidence that people will pay costs to avoid being asked and avoid social pressure. However, for this same case *if* they are asked they then to respond by giving. While "avoiding the ask" is not avoiding cost-benefit analysis, it suggests that people are in fact strategic in avoiding things that  may make them feel compelled to donate. 
Note: This evidence is only tangentially relevant.
</div>

\

#### Evidence for "People rarely seek out effectiveness information and are reluctant to purchase it" {-}

<!-- TODO - Cite: That survey-based study where few people say that they have
looked into the effectiveness information on the charities they donate
to -->

In the final stage of an experiment from @Null2011b:

> Subjects were given the option to spend USD 5 of their total gift to the
> development charities in order to find out which of the three would
> receive a matching rate of USD 3 (the other two would receive matching
> rates of USD 1.50). Altruistic subjects whose donation was at least USD 20
> and gave to all three charities, or whose total gift is greater than
> USD 35 and gave to two charities, would find it profitable to purchase
> the information. ... (84%) met these criteria on gift size and number
> of charities supported.

> ...only 40% of subjects were willing to give up a small portion of
> their endowments in order to find out which charity would receive the
> highest rate; the rest preferred to allocate their gifts without
> knowing what they would be worth to the charities."

> \...These subjects who chose not to purchase the information
> forfeited matching funds ranging from 30-150% of the value of their
> unmatched gifts, with the median donor sacrificing matching funds
> exactly equal to the value of her unmatched gift, a truly staggering
> sum.

\

Null attributes this failure to buy information either to subjects who "simply did not care about the potential to substitute into the charity with the highest matching rate", perhaps driven by some form of simplistic warm glow motive, or to simple misunderstanding or fatigue (in an incentivized elicitation, she found some evidence of incomplete comprehension). To the extent this is *not* a misunderstanding, it might be seen as evidence of CBA aversion; participants did not want to purchase evidence that would require them to do calculations in this domain.

\

<!-- Todo: investigate these references...

While most donors say their primary motivation is to make a difference, few donors seek information about charities before deciding where to give (Camber Collective, 2015; Hope Consulting, 2010, 2011; Osili et al., 2016). When they do conduct research, data on impact ranks lower than other types of information, such as the charity’s financial overhead and the demographics of the program recipients (Metzger & Günther, 2019)
-->

#### Evidence for "People do not respond 'efficiently' to information about costs and benefits" {-}

<div class="marginnote">
This might be moved into to the next section
</div>
 

@Null2011b ran a set of experiments at Kiwanis/Rotary clubs and with "professional subjects" (university administrators?) at the Berkeley X-lab; the former strictly involved allocations *among* charities, in the latter case what was not given away could be kept. For the main reported treatments, participants made a series of decisions under different incentives (mostly on the same page and thus simultaneously?). The "prize" was \$100; in each session only one decision from one subject was chosen for actual payment/donations.

Many participants who choose to donate positive amounts to multiple charities in earlier (?stages) continue to donate to multiple charities when one charity is given a better match rate; they only "imperfectly substitute" (and some even substitute away from the now "lower-priced" charity). She attributes this to both risk aversion (diminishing utility in to each charity's actual impact, along with uncertainty about this impact) as well to as a version of "warm glow" with a diminishing marginal benefit in the amount given to each charity.

<div class="marginnote">
She also introduces exogenous risks over matching rates, and notes that roughly 2/3 of those that choose to shift only imperfectly are not measured to be "risk averse".
</div>
 
However, this could also be attributed to a simple failure to make these cost-benefit calculations (as she also found some evidence suggesting misunderstanding
of the nature of these incentives).


<div class="marginnote">

#### Evidence for "people accept and value subjectivity in the charitable domain more so than for other choice domains" {#subjectivity}

**[@Berman2018]** provide evidence from a series of five survey/vignette experiments; unlike those mentioned above, these (mostly) involve hypothetical choices among *multiple* causes. All experiments use standard subject pools (behavioral lab subjects or m-turkers) with reasonably large samples. All ask for hypothetical (Likert-scale) responses involving fictional charities, investments, and other scenarios; they mostly rely on between-subject responses, and their statistical analyses report reasonable tests on the relevant comparisons. 
A short summary from @Berman2018 on their findings (unfold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

> Study 1 showed that, relative to personal decisions, individuals view charity as being relatively subjective. Study 2 showed that individuals prioritize emotional connection over welfare maximization when comparing charity options. Study 3 examined choice processes and found that people are more likely to override welfare maximization when choosing a charity than when choosing a financial investment. The final two studies found that individuals are less likely to license themselves (Study 4) and others (Study 5) to select an ineffective option when a decision maker assumes a position of responsibility. 

```

<div class="marginnote">
@Berman2018 also point to @goodwin2008psychology for an examination of ‘objectivism’ generally, and @spiller2017consumer for their discussion of objectivity in consumer decisions.
</div>

Their "Study 1: Perceived Subjectivity of Charity" found that, in rating statements such as "it is important that the ______ I choose reflects my personal tastes or values" and "It is more important to rely on objective measures rather than personal feelings when choosing ______  \... they found people agreed more with the *subjective/taste* approach when assigned a treatment where the blank was "Charity", relative to those assigned treatments involving medical treatments, investments, and cell phones. (But less than some other things like art, and similar to restaurants in some tests!) 

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Methodology from @Berman2018

> Participants were asked to evaluate how they believe they should make decisions across six decision domains (choosing a charity, an investment, a cell phone, a restaurant, a piece of art, and a medical treatment). Specifically, they evaluated the extent to which they agreed with the following statements: “It is important that the _____ I choose reflects my personal tastes or values,” “It is more important to rely on objective measures rather than personal feelings when choosing _____,” and “Objective measures are the best way to choose _____.” Responses were made on a scale from 1 (*not at all*) to 7 (*very much so*).

```

Their "Study 2: Personal Feelings Versus Welfare Gains" presented participants with "Mary" and a pairing of fictional domestic (homelessness) and international (micronutrient) charities, presenting effectiveness information on both (clearly favoring the latter). The treatment\-- which charity Mary felt an emotional connection to\-- had a significant impact on the response to "Which charity should Mary donate to", in the predicted direction. They were also asked: "Which option does the greatest good for the greatest number of people?"; here responses favored the international charity for both treatments; but even so, when Mary felt connected to local charity, participants favored donating there.

```{block2,  type='fold'}

Methodology from @Berman2018

> Participants read a scenario involving Mary, who was looking to donate money to one of two hypothetical charities. One charity, Hunger Care in Africa, was described as providing micronutrients for children in Africa, and for each USD 100 donated, this charity could feed five children for a month. A second charity, Jump Start Your Community, was described as training and educating the homeless in Mary’s community, and for every USD 100 donated, this charity could provide 2 hr of job training to one homeless person

> Each participant was then randomly assigned to one of two emotional-connection conditions. In the local-causes condition, participants read that Mary feels an emotional connection toward helping people in local communities, whereas in the distant-causes condition, participants read that Mary feels an emotional connection toward helping those in third-world countries 

> We then presented participants with two different questions on separate pages in random order. One question assessed where they felt Mary should donate (“Which charity should Mary donate to?”), whereas the other question asked which charity was the most effective at maximizing social welfare (“Suppose that Mary wanted to donate to the charity that did the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Which one should she donate to?”). Both questions were measured on a 7-point scale from 1 (definitely Jump Start Your Community) to 7 (definitely Hunger Care in Africa)

@Berman2018 summarized their results from this study as follows:
> When participants read that Mary felt an emotional connection with distant charities, they responded that she should donate to Hunger Care in Africa… and also evaluated it as being more effective… However, when Mary felt connected to local communities, they indicated that she should donate to Jump Start Your Community…, despite indicating that Hunger Care in Africa was more effective 

```


<div class="marginnote">

Somewhat puzzlingly, Mary\'s connection to the charity also
affected the stated "effectiveness" response! This bears a closer
look.
</div>
 
In their "Study 3: Charity Versus Investment Choice", subjects were assigned categories and fictional examples of either charities or investment, and presented domain categories and effectiveness information for each. Fewer participants in the charity treatment (relative to the investment treatment) chose to sort by effectiveness rating, and fewer chose the highest rated option.
 
```{block2,  type='fold'}

Study 3 built on the ideas from Study 1. Effective altruism suggests that to make the biggest difference, people should try and maximize welfare, similar to how investors try and maximize their financial returns. However, Study 1 suggested that individuals viewed objective information as more important in making financial decisions than in charitable decisions. The third study from @Berman2018 tries to more directly compare the two, using the following method: 

> Participants were also told that the website organizes options into six different categories (alternative energy, cancer, education, food, housing, and international). These categories were chosen because they could plausibly represent groupings of either charities or investments.
> Participants were then given the choice to sort the options either by effectiveness or by category type. Sorting by effectiveness suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting one of the most effective charities or investments, whereas sorting by category suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting a charity or investment that reflected a preferred option type

They found that participants were significantly more likely to sort by effectiveness in the investment condition than in the charity condition. Furthermore, when the options were ranked, “participants chose a less effective charity… than investment”.


```

<div class="marginnote">
There is significantly more detail on the methodology of this study in the full paper from @Berman2018, and there is a discussion of additional measures, a mediation analysis, and robustness check studies
</div>

Study 4 and 5 both examined how responsibility changes people’s perception of how important objective information is. @Berman2018 hypothesized that “when individuals assume a role of responsibility, they may feel obligated to act in accordance with the welfare of the entire group and will discount their personal preferences to do so”.

In Study 4, they find that, in rating research departments for funding, participants pay more attention to charity effectiveness ratings when the are given the "role" of a "president of a local medical research center" rather than a donor. Similarly, in Study 5 participants assess someone who allocates funds to a research department; participants respond to the effectiveness of the department chosen more when rating the decision quality and altruism/selfishness of a "president..." than rating a "donor". 

Study 4 (unfold)
```{block2,  type='fold'}

In Study 4, participants were assigned to a donor condition or a president condition, and then participants were either given information on effectiveness ratings, or there was no mention of effectiveness ratings.

> Participants assigned to the donor condition imagined that they lived near a local research center. Participants assigned to the president condition imagined that they were the president of a local medical research center. Participants in the donor condition were then told that “because the market has done well, you have more cash than usual. You would like to help by making a donation to medical research.” Participants in the president condition were told that “Because the stock market has done well, the research center has more cash than usual. As president, it is part of your job to allocate these funds to conduct additional medical research.”
> Each participant was then given his or her choice between allocating funds to one of three departments, with effectiveness ratings provided for each department… These ratings were purposefully selected so that the most intuitively appealing choice was rated as the least effective (cancer), and the least appealing choice was rated as the most effective (arthritis), thereby creating a tension between the option that would be most personally gratifying and the option that would maximize welfare

Their results suggested that people paid more attention to the effectiveness ratings when they were in a position of responsibility:

> When the effectiveness ratings were absent, the assigned role did not significantly affect the option that participants chose… However, when the ratings were present, participants in the president condition were significantly more likely to select higher rated options than those in the donor condition… Although participants used effectiveness ratings when given this information, significantly more did so when placed in a position of responsibility

```

Study 5 (unfold)
```{block2,  type='fold'}

Their fifth study used a similar methodology to Study 4, to examine “how individuals judge others who select either a relatively effective or an ineffective option”, using the following method: 

> The study has a 2 (role: donor vs. medical center president) x 2 (choice: most effective option vs. least effective option) between-subjects design. Participants read a scenario about Mr. Peterson, an individual who was allocating money to a local medical research center. In the donor condition, participants read that Mr. Peterson was looking to donate money from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center. In the president condition, participants read that Mr. Peterson was the president of the medical research center and that he was looking to allocate surplus funds from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center
> In all conditions, participants then read about an independent research firm that evaluates the effectiveness of departments in the same fashion as the previous study 
> ... Participants then evaluated the extent to which they thought the decision was responsible, appropriate, and thoughtful

As with Study 4, the results suggested that people thought effectiveness information was more important for people in positions of responsibility: 

> In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr. Peterson’s decision was of lower quality when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, the drop in decision quality was significantly greater when he was president… than when he was a donor
> In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr. Peterson’s decision was less altruistic when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, this difference was greater when Mr. Peterson was president… than when he was a donor

```

Overall, these suggest that, when considering charitable donations,
people tend to favor--or at least to accept--the use of subjective
preferences and personal ties, rather than objective information, and
they do so more than for more "standard" goods and choices. This is more
accepted for "donors" than for people with responsibility for others'
funds.

In their analysis of the studies, @Berman2018 concluded with the following: 

> Our results suggest that people view charity decisions as being relatively subjective, which inhibits the impact of effectiveness information on welfare maximization. Thus, to persuade people to make donation decisions that maximize social welfare, providing information alone may not be sufficient. Rather, it may require altering how individuals view their role as a donor altogether

<div class="marginnote">
Berman et al argue that their results demonstrate the acceptance of the suggestive preferences is somewhat attenuated by the \"role of responsibility\", but it\'s not clear what this term means or how this could be relevant to voluntary individual giving. 
</div>

However (as they do note), the effectiveness information
still has *some* (positive) effect on participants' responses; it is not
ignored. Their experiments also do not analyze the *avoidance* of
information or CBA.

**Methodological strengths and weaknesses:** 

- hypothetical nature of choices

- some evidence suggestng these are not taken seriously

- specific context in vignettes allow alternative interpretations...

Average donations increase in response to information about the recipient type and decrease in response to information about administrative costs. Information about aid impact does not significantly change average donations: donors who demand information respond positively to high impact projects and negatively to low impact projects, resulting in a zero net effect on donation levels. Our results further show that information has the same effect on donation behavior regardless of whether it is provided for free or at a cost.

```{block2,  type='note'}

A subjective outline of the evidence:
  
The evidence (from the Economics/Behavioral Economics literature) is largely mixed and indeterminate. There has been only a single strong field trial [@karlanEffectEffectivenessDonor2017a] in a particular context, which itself reported mixed (null overall, positive for some subgroups, negative for others), and some underpowered results. Laboratory experiments (with real donations) by Small et al find that giving to an identifiable victim is *reduced* when statistics are also presented and "priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime." Further evidence from lab experiments is mixed and limited, with some studies [@fongTruthGivingExperimental2010] *apparently* finding that exogenous information about recipient increases donations (although they do not report this).  There is some speculation, but again, mixed evidence, that individuals already in a "system 2" (deliberative) frame are more likely to be positively affected by impact information. There is also a distinction to be further explored between "output information" (how the donation is used) and "impact information"; the former is seen to increase generosity in several studies.

### Presenting "Effectiveness" and other types of analytical efficiency information

#### @karlanEffectEffectivenessDonor2017b

> While @karlanEffectEffectivenessDonor2017b did find that those who had previously donated large amounts gave more when they received effectiveness information (and Parsons found similar effects for efficiency and prior donors), the reason for this effect is unclear. For example, large/frequent donors may experience a greater pressure to donate in light of any new positive information.

> According to studies on our programs in Peru that used rigorous scientific methodologies, women who have received both loans and business education saw their profits grow, even when compared to women who just received loans for their businesses. But the real difference comes when times are slow. The study showed that women in Freedom from Hunger's Credit with Education program kept their profits strong–ensuring that their families would not suffer, but thrive.

As Sebastiana's young son, Aurelio, runs up to hug her, she says, “I do whatever I can for my children.”

Further details from Parsons (unfold, direct quotes from paper)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

(This is all direct quotations:) 

Potential donors were sent, via a direct mail
campaign, fundraising appeals containing varying amounts of financial and nonfinancial
information in order to determine whether individual donors are more likely to contribute
when accounting information or voluntary disclosures are provided ...

\

A logistic regression provides evidence that some donors who have previously
donated use financial accounting information when making a donation decision. The
results are inconclusive regarding whether donors use nonfinancial service efforts and
accomplishments disclosures to determine whether and how much to give, but participants in the lab experiment judged the nonfinancial disclosures to be useful for making
a giving decision

\

Both experiments use a two-by-two design to manipulate the direct provision of (1)
financial information (derived from mandatory informational tax filings which are available
only if requested by the donor) and (2) voluntary disclosure of nonfinancial accounting
information (not otherwise available to the donor). By analyzing actual cash receipts from
the fundraising appeal, I find that donors who had previously contributed to the organization
are more likely to donate when financial accounting information is directly provided. New
prospective donors make larger contributions when either financial information or voluntary,
nonfinancial accounting information is included with a basic fundraising appeal, but differences are not statistically significant. 

\

The first manipulation is to include financial information
drawn from the audited financial statements with the basic fundraising appeal. Summary
charts and graphs, instead of full financial statements complete with footnotes, are used to
highlight the efficiency measures typically emphasized in previous literature. The financial
information indicates that 92.5 percent of the entity's expenditures were directed to program
expenses in the prior year. This figure compares favorably with the 60 percent suggested
minimum level recommended by the National Charities Information Bureau

\
The second manipulation is to include a voluntary disclosure of service efforts and
accomplishments (SEA) that describes the organization's past efforts to serve its beneficiaries and gives specific information about the success of its programs (see Appendix C).
This information is in narrative form and written in lay terms. 3 It provides both output
(quantity of product or service produced) and outcomes (results) information as defined in
Hatry et al. (1990).

From Abstract:

>  Across six experiments we examined how images of identified victims interact with information about charity efficiency (money toward program) and effectiveness (program outcome). We further examined if the images primarily get people to donate (yes/no), while efficiency/effectiveness might provide a tuning mechanism for how much to give. Results showed that images influenced the propensity to donate and induced participants donate their full bonuses, indicating heuristic effects. Efficiency and effectiveness information had no effects on donations.

```

(Note that in the above, all binary variables are 'effect coded')
Considering 'Don share' (the share of the endowment contributed), as well as the linear probability model, we see that the pooled effect of the effectiveness information is fairly tightly bounded around zero. Even at the 95% lower bound, the effect is no more than an 11% reduction in the share donated (.04/0.35), and a 10% reduction in incidence (.06/.62).

\
Study 6 had the most straightforward 'impact information' as per our definitions.

> Above we see estimated of odds ratios, relative to the control group, of the incidence of donating to RB (Carter Center: the river-blindness charity) and GD (Guide Dogs for the blind). Confidence intervals reveal a lack of power. However, there is suggestive evidence (p=0.09 and p=0.16, respectively) that the image lead people to be less-likely to donate to GD and more likely to donate to RB. This may have been driven by the African appearance of the blind girl depicted.  

The wide confidence intervals of the odds ratios suggests that Study 6 had limited statstical power.

- Series of hypothetical experiments, mainly on M-Turk

> Abstract: ... Across six tasks (Studies 1a, 1b), we found support for both explanations. Among lay donors, we observed multiple misconceptions—regarding disaster relief, overhead costs, donation splitting, and the relative effectiveness of local and foreign charities—that reduced thee ffectiveness of their giving. 

> Similarly, we found that they were unfamiliar with the most effective charities (Studies 2a, 2b). Debunking these misconceptions and informing people about effectiveness boosted effective donations; however, a portion of lay donors continued to give ineffectively to satisfy their personal preferences.

> By contrast, a sample of self-identified effective altruists gave effectively across all tasks. 

#### [@mulesky2020demand]

**Setup** 

- Participants "recruited through Positly, an online study recruiter that solicits high quality participants from Amazon’s M-Turk"

- Series of experiments giving participants a *hypothetical* choice: "you have the opportunity to donate 100 USD to i. [described charity] or ii. Some other international health charity." They needed to hypothetically allocate the 100USD completely between these two. 


Study 1 treatments: 

- No Impact information
- Null Impact information ("study found that Human Rights International did not have the desired impact, suggesting that reform is needed to increase effectiveness’.)
- Realistic impact information ... "results of the study suggest ... [HHI} saves the life of one person for each 2000 USD spent"
- Unrealistic impact information "... for each 150 USD spent"

Study 2: Similar to Study 1, but for preventing HIV infections

<div class="marginnote">
The third study revolves around the addition of overhead information, in with what might be seen as a fairly negative presentation. I do not discuss it here </div>

\

**Results considered**
 
Stated finding:
> Charities are only rewarded for revealing information about their impact when the results are unrealistic and unattainable. 

In fact, the mean donations were ordered: Unrealistic (Impact information) $>$ Realistic $>$ No(ne) $>$ Null. 

While the difference between Realistic and None was not significant by the standard tests, the confidence interval does not rule out an affect of up to almost 15 percentage points.


<!--  Third, donors may reward unrealistic impact information, creating a financial incentive for charities to deceive the public into thinking they are more effective than is realistically achievable. -->

      
### Evidence: Analytical information $\times$ emotional information and 'identifiable victim'

 [@kogut2011identifiable; @loewensteinScarecrowTinMan2007; @Small2007]
 [@Drouvelis2016], [@Caviola2014]
 
#### [@Small2007], studies 3-4 {-}

Study 3: 

> individuals who faced an identifiable victim donated more than those who faced victim statistics, p < .01, and also donated more than those who faced an identifiable victim in conjunction with statistics, p < .05.

(They interpret the statistics as possibly 'debiasing' the IVE)

\

> Study 4: "Priming analytic thinking [math problems] reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime ["impression questionnaire"]. Yet, the primes had no distinct effect on donations to statistical victims, which is symptomatic of the difficulty in generating feelings for these victims."

\

**Considerations**

Basic design has key strengths: Double-blind, real donations, distractors, careful use of language.

Primes: Note, the latter non-effect appears tightly bounded; but this could simply be driven by nonlinearity. If people gave little to statistical victims, there is less room for this to decrease further. A classic problem when considering interactions.

Ideas42 Summary: 

Researchers gave study participants the opportunity to donate $0-5 to famine relief efforts at Save the Children (n = 159). One group received letters that included a picture and brief description of a little girl. A second group received letters describing factual information about food security, and a third group received letters with both the little girl’s profile and factual information. The photo and description prompted an emotion-based response, raising more than twice as much money as the factual solicitation. Including factual information with the girl’s profile reduced this effect, with no significant difference in giving between those who received both pieces and those who received factual information only

## Overall 'net' responses to charity ratings {#ratings}

There is a small body of evidence on how charity quality ratings (which are not typically 'impact' ratings as we have defined it) affect, or at least correlate with a  charity's fundraising success. The effect of these ratings presumably relates both to individual's willingness to seek out and process this information ([as in our discussion of CBA](#cba-aversion)), and to the impact of this information on an individual's generosity (as in our discussion of . If individual's strongly avoided seeing this information and ignored being exposed to this information 

### Evidence on responses to charity ratings

One characterization, from @bergh2020empathic

>  Some work further suggests that changes in charity ratings lead to changes in charity revenues (e.g., @Gordon2009; @Yoruk2016), but it is unclear if this is driven by efficiency evaluations per se. For instance, people might respond to the number of stars given to a charity without deeply considering what these stars represent.


#### @Yoruk2016. {-}

**"Charity ratings" Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 25(1), 195-219.**

\
**Relevance**: Reasonably strong causal evidence that in general, charity ratings may boost a charity's fundraising, at least for some types of charities. However, this is based on Charity Navigator ratings, which do not generally agree with our measures of impact.

\ 

**Type of evidence:**  Observational, claiming causality through a regression discontinuity framework

- Charity Navigator stars are based on a continuous score across categories
- Identification via RD: Impact of crossing a 'star' threshold on amounts raised

\

**Background mechanisms and related evidence:**  the role of consumer reviews and independent ratings in for-profit sectors, e.g. Luca(2011): one star increase in online rating leads to a 5 to 9 percent increase in revenue, @jin2006information: health plan ratings have a significant impact on individuals’ health plan choices, @reinsteinInfluenceExpertReviews2005: positive expert reviews have a significant effect on the box office revenue of movies.

\

**Key findings:**

- For relatively smaller and unknown charities one star increase in ratings is (causally) associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received

# Appendix: Tech for creating, editing and collaborating on this 'Bookdown' web book/project (and starting your own) {#bookdown-appendix}

## Introduction

This appendix provides a brief introduction to the several types of software and processes used to creating websites such as [Increasing Effective Charitable Giving](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/outline.html) and [Researching and writing for Economics students](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html). We aim to encourage others to participate in this collaborative work, and to spin off their own projects. 


```{block2,  type='note'}

This site (web-book project) is
  
<!-- Add internal links here -->

Hosted: 
- Hosted on Github (Github pages)
- A project managed out of a Git repo stored in Github

\

The content is:
- A 'Bookdown' (in the 'Gitbook' style, although we've drawn elements from the Tufte style)
- ...which is a hosted collection of HTML (and other) files...
- ...constructed/compiled/built from R-Markdown (.Rmd) files and other support files using the R language

\

This relies heavily on:

- 'Markdown syntax' for basic writing/formatting
- Latex for mathematics notation
- Bibtex for references/citations
- 'Pandoc' to convert between different document formats
- CSS (style sheets)

\

To build this, we chose to use tools and software including:

- The RStudio environment for working with R code
- Github desktop to manage pushing/pulling and integrating content (although sometimes we use raw Git)
- Features of the GitHub website such as 'projects'

```  

We first give a *brief* overview of R & RStudio, Git & Github, and R Markdown & Bookdown, linking more extensive further resources/tutorials.

## R and RStudio

* **R** is a free programming language which is mainly used for data analysis and statistics. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.r-project.org/). The popularity of R is growing in Economics Academia, largely due to the growth of Machine Learning techniques in R as well as the flexibility of the language itself.
R makes use of **packages** which are a collection of functions written in order to achieve specific tasks. Whilst R comes pre-installed with a variety of useful packages, it is often useful to install more, which can be done using the *install.packages* command.  <div class="marginnote">
If you are familiar with Python, these R packages are roughly comparable to Python's **modules**.

```  
 

* **RStudio** is a programming environment and interface which helps facilitate  a variety of tasks such as writing scripts using R (as well as other languages), and  building/knitting these into various document formats. RStudio 'Addins' can also be extremely useful for things like tracking 'todos', adding citations, and formatting code. RStudio can also be configured so as to work seamlessly with Git (more on this later). RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://rstudio.com/)

## Git and Github

* **Git** is a version control system which enables users to track changes and progress in coding projects or any files in general. It is particularly useful for collaborating on projects as it provides a useful way to show who has altered which files and when. Users are even able to clone a _repository_ (a folder inside of a project which tracks all changes made) and make changes without affecting the original project. Git also provides a very simple way to keep changes to projects up to date across different operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Installation and configuration of Git can be confusing to the newly-initiated user, [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) provides a user friendly tutorial on installing Git, [which can be downloaded here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Some key things to know about Git and GitHub  
  
Git and GitHub can be a bit confusing.  Here are some things that I wish I had known, that took my a while to figure out (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Git and Github are not the same thing ... (explain)

- A 'commit' does not actually change the files in the shared (remote) Github repo; you need to 'push' to do that

- After 'pulling' from the remote repo, you may need to merge changes... (explain)

- You can have several different 'branches' of the same Repo existing at the same time. When you switch to a new 'branch' the files you see on your computer will instantly and amazingly change to exactly the files in that branch. But don't worry, the old branch is not lost. 

- ... add some more

```

A brief overview of key functions inside Git (assuming a remote Github repo) including commits, pushes & pulls, forks & branches and pull requests: (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

* A **commit** saves the changes made in the current document to the **local** repository. Specific changes to commit to the remote (online) repo must be specified. This process is made much easier using a program such as Github Desktop rather than the Git code itself (although they do the same thing, and the latter is more flexible).
* A **push**, pushes all local commits to the online version of this repository, essentially updating the online version of the files, to the version which is stored locally on your device.
* A **pull**, is used to pull the changes made to the online repository, into the local repository. Thus making the local repository up to date with the remote/online repository. 
* Creating a **branch** allows you to create a separate version of a repository and make changes to this without affecting the master/original repository.
* A **pull request** then allows you to pull the changes made in a branch over to the master repository, in order to merge the work. 
* As noted, **Github Desktop** provides a user interface for a more simple and intuitive way to use Git.  There are a variety of other interfaces.
  * Github can also be integrated into RStudio and into many other tools, such as the Atom text editor. 
* Repos that are stored on Github can be accessed via a browser at [github.com](https://github.com/). The Github website itself provides a wide variety of tools.

```
 
## Markdown and Bookdown

* **Markdown** is a popular set of formats (really a 'syntax for specifying output') for generating and authoring documents. The Rmarkdown format (rmarkdown package) is one flavor of Markdown that works with R to enable 'dynamic documents' involving text, data-analysis, and other elements. It can then export your work to a variety of outputs such as html, pdf and word documents. As well as this it can also be used to create webpages, such as the one you are currently reading. The power of Markdown files comes from the way that they are able include/embed code as well as data and tables, which is useful for writing reproducible research and creating websites.\

- The **Bookdown** package was built on the Rmarkdown package, but it adds many features to enable larger and more structured output, particularly 'web books' and web sites. As we use it, this these books combine multiple Rmarkdown files, with each such 'Rmd' file becoming its own HTML page. 

<div class="marginnote">
Look at the list of headings on the left of this page: each second-level header is it's own web-page (a distinct html link). "All the content in one scrolled page" is limited to a single first-level header. 
<!-- @Oska -- perhaps you can say this better -->

## The code and folder structure in this repo,  and what it means

### Writing_econ_book: Files-folders of interest (taken from readme March 2020)

docs: html output put here for web hosting

**Folder: [writing_econ_book](writing_econ_book)**

- [bookdown.yml](writing_econ_book/bookdown.yml): determines which files are included in the book
- [writing_econ_gfm.Rmd](writing_econ_book/writing_econ_gfm.Rmd): The main content; body of the book (many chapters) 
- index.Rmd: Setup content and some styling/parameters; determines how the book is built (into which format, etc)
- header_include.html: Important commands included here including folding boxes  
- references_cut.bib: bibtex references referred to in '@ref' notes
- tufte_plus.css: Determines layout and styling 
- writing_econ_book.Rproj: 'project' ... to work on this in R-studio

# Appendix: Tech for creating, editing and collaborating on this 'Bookdown' web book/project (and starting your own) {#bookdown-appendix}

*This tutorial written by Oska Fentem with David Reinstein*

## Introduction

This appendix provides a brief introduction to the several types of
software and processes used to creating websites such as [Increasing
Effective Charitable
Giving](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/outline.html) and
[Researching and writing for Economics
students](https://daaronr.github.io/writing_econ_research/about-this-work.html).
We aim to encourage others to participate in this collaborative work,
and to spin off their own projects. If you would like to provide
feedback or ask a question about these projects then using
['hypothes.is'](https://web.hypothes.is/) is an easy way to do so.

You can also contribute content through the Airtable forms (see
[above](#airtable-contrib)).

```{block2,  type='note'}
The template for my bookdown projects is maintained in my repo [here](https://github.com/daaronr/dr-rstuff/tree/master/bookdown_template)
```

```{block2,  type='note'}

**This site (web-book project) is**

<!-- TODO: Add internal and web links here -->

Hosted:

- Hosted on Github (Github pages)
- A project managed out of a Git repo stored in Github

\

**The content is:**

- A 'Bookdown' (in the 'Gitbook' style, although we've drawn elements from the Tufte style)
- ...which is a hosted collection of HTML (and other) files...
- ...constructed/compiled/built from R-Markdown (.Rmd) files and other support files using the R language

\

This relies heavily on:

- 'Markdown syntax' for basic writing/formatting
- Latex for mathematics notation
- Bibtex for references/citations
- 'Pandoc' to convert between different document formats
- CSS (style sheets)

\

To build this, we chose to use tools and software including:

- The RStudio environment for working with R code
- Github desktop to manage pushing/pulling and integrating content (although sometimes we use raw Git)
- Features of the GitHub website such as 'projects'

```

We first give a *brief* overview of R & RStudio, Git & Github, and R
Markdown & Bookdown, linking more extensive further resources/tutorials.

## Git and Github

-   **Git** is a version control system which enables users to track
    changes and progress in coding projects or any files in general. It
    is particularly useful for collaborating on projects as it provides
    a useful way to show who has altered which files and when. Users are
    even able to clone a *repository* (a folder inside of a project
    which tracks all changes made) and make changes without affecting
    the original project. Git also provides a very simple way to keep
    changes to projects up to date across different operating systems
    such as Windows and Mac. Installation and configuration of Git can
    be confusing to the newly-initiated user, [Happy
    Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) provides a user friendly
    tutorial on installing Git, [which can be downloaded
    here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Some key things to know about Git and GitHub

A brief overview of key functions inside Git (assuming a remote Github
repo) including commits, pushes & pulls, forks & branches and pull
requests: (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

* **Cloning** a Git repository copies an existing Git repository into your local file space.
* A **commit** saves the changes made in the current document to the **local** repository. Specific changes to commit to the remote (online) repo must be specified. This process is made much easier using a program such as Github Desktop rather than the Git code itself (although they do the same thing, and the latter is more flexible).
* A **push**, pushes all local commits to the online version of this repository, essentially updating the online version of the files, to the version which is stored locally on your device.
* A **pull**, is used to pull the changes made to the online repository, into the local repository. Thus making the local repository up to date with the remote/online repository.
* Creating a **branch** allows you to create a separate version of a repository and make changes to this without affecting the master/original repository.
* A **pull request** then allows you to pull the changes made in a branch over to the master repository, in order to merge the work.
* As noted, **Github Desktop** provides a user interface for a more simple and intuitive way to use Git.  There are a variety of other interfaces.
  * Github can also be integrated into RStudio and into many other tools, such as the Atom text editor.
* Repos that are stored on Github can be accessed via a browser at [github.com](https://github.com/). The Github website itself provides a wide variety of tools, discussed further below under ['GitHub web page'](github_web),

```

\
Git and GitHub can be a bit confusing. Here are some things that I wish
I had known, that took my a while to figure out (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

- Git and Github are not the same thing ... (explain)

- A 'commit' does not actually change the files in the shared (remote) Github repo; you need to 'push' to do that

- After 'pulling' from the remote repo, you may need to merge changes... (explain)

- You can have several different 'branches' of the same Repo existing at the same time. When you switch to a new 'branch' the files you see on your computer will instantly and amazingly change to exactly the files in that branch. But don't worry, the old branch is not lost.

- ... add some more

```

## R and RStudio

-   **R** is a free programming language which is mainly used for data
    analysis and statistics. It can be downloaded
    [here](https://www.r-project.org/). The popularity of R is growing
    in Economics Academia, largely due to the growth of Machine Learning
    techniques in R as well as the flexibility of the language itself. R
    makes use of **packages** which are a collection of functions
    written in order to achieve specific tasks. Whilst R comes
    pre-installed with a variety of useful packages, it is often useful
    to install more, which can be done using the *install.packages*
    command.

    ::: {.marginnote}
    If you are familiar with Python, these R packages are roughly
    comparable to Python's **modules**.
    :::

```{block2,  type='note'}
Installing R should take about XXX minutes.

Here's a guide to exactly how to do it.
```

-   **RStudio** is a programming environment and interface which helps
    facilitate a variety of tasks such as writing scripts using R (as
    well as other languages), and building/knitting these into various
    document formats. RStudio 'Addins' can also be extremely useful for
    things like tracking 'todos', adding citations, and formatting code.
    RStudio can also be configured so as to work seamlessly with Git
    (more on this later). RStudio can be downloaded
    [here](https://rstudio.com/)

```{block2,  type='note'}
Installing and configuring RStudio should take about XXX minutes.

Here's a guide to exactly how to do it.
```

## Markdown and Bookdown

-   **Markdown** is a popular set of formats (really a 'syntax for
    specifying output') for generating and authoring documents. The
    Rmarkdown format (rmarkdown package) is one flavor of Markdown that
    works with R to enable 'dynamic documents' involving text,
    data-analysis, and other elements. It can then export your work to a
    variety of outputs such as html, pdf and word documents. As well as
    this it can also be used to create webpages, such as the one you are
    currently reading. The power of Markdown files comes from the way
    that they are able include/embed code as well as data and tables,
    which is useful for writing reproducible research and creating
    websites.\

-   The **Bookdown** package was built on the Rmarkdown package, but it
    adds many features to enable larger and more structured output,
    particularly 'web books' and web sites. As we use it, this these
    books combine multiple Rmarkdown files, with each such 'Rmd' file
    becoming its own HTML page.

::: {.marginnote}
Look at the list of headings on the left of this page: each second-level
header is it's own web-page (a distinct html link). "All the content in
one scrolled page" is limited to a single first-level header.
<!-- @Oska -- perhaps you can say this better -->
:::

```{block2,  type='note'}

**[stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#)** can help you practice your markdown, or work on it in a nearly-WYSIWYG environment.

To work on the files in a github archive directly in stackedit.io:

- Make sure you are a member of the archive
- Go to https://stackedit.io/app#

- Click the "#" in the upper right corner
- Click 'synchronise' and add your github account
- Click 'open from github'
- Fill in the url for the github repo, e.g., https://github.com/daaronr/ea_giving_barriers/,
    - and the (folder and) file you want to edit, such as README.MD) (Not sure if rmd works; gotta check)

It should then come out with two panels. Left panel=code, right panel=output in a nice format, auto-updating. You can open one, close the other, etc., and there are lots of tips/tools.

Hitting 'synchronise' should push your changes to the Github repo (but doublecheck this is working)

```

## The code and folder structure in this repo, and what it means

### Writing_econ_book: Files-folders of interest (taken from readme March 2020)

docs: html output put here for web hosting

**Folder: [writing_econ_book](writing_econ_book)**

-   [bookdown.yml](writing_econ_book/bookdown.yml): determines which
    files are included in the book
-   [writing_econ_gfm.Rmd](writing_econ_book/writing_econ_gfm.Rmd): The
    main content; body of the book (many chapters)
-   index.Rmd: Setup content and some styling/parameters; determines how
    the book is built (into which format, etc)
-   header_include.html: Important commands included here including
    folding boxes
-   references_cut.bib: bibtex references referred to in '\@ref' notes
-   tufte_plus.css: Determines layout and styling
-   writing_econ_book.Rproj: 'project' ... to work on this in R-studio

## Adding the main content... the code in a single ".Rmd" file

*...and how it translates into content*

```{block2,  type='note'}

**Video guides**

- In the [video: intro to rmd and bookdown - template HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sw6i7hws15903a3/bookdown_template_rmd_intro.mp4?dl=0) I introduce the basics of the Bookdown setup and folder structure, using the [bookdown template repo files](https://github.com/daaronr/dr-rstuff/tree/master/bookdown_template) as an example.

- I further discuss the elements of the .Rmd (and associated) files, and how they translate into html output in the [video: rmarkdown content from template HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p724socu1pmjous/rmarkdown-bookdown-content.mp4?dl=0)

- A final video that focuses a bit more on adding citations is [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/30ix6h3sxr24k9j/the_bookdown_and_editing_rmd.mp4?dl=0) -- this latter video has a very large file size, sorry.

*My apologies*: In these videos my dumb head is blocking an important part of the screen share. It may help you to have the original files up to see the missing bits. I hope to redo these when I have a chance.

*Note:* The key files and settings for my bookdown projects are maintained in my repo [here](https://github.com/daaronr/dr-rstuff/tree/master/bookdown_template), along with a minimal example. This is (or should be) synchronised with all the other repos.

```

```{block2,  type='note'}

**A tip: 'find in files'**

'Find in files' is a nice tool when working in Rstudio for a project combining many files. 

In menu bar, select:
- Edit
- Find in files...

Or use the (built in?) shortcut (in Mac) `<Shift>-<cmd>-f`
  
  
```

### Basic (R-)Markdown

<!-- Could do with rewording -->

The Markdown format offers a simple plain-text notation for specifying
the elements of documents, reports, web sites, etc. (It is much simpler
and easier to read than html, latex, etc.) It is widely used by
programmers, on comment boards/forums, and throughout the internet. For
example, GitHub.com automatically renders markdown code, particularly in
`readme.md` files.

::: {.marginnote}
Actually there are several varieties of markdown, but they mainly share
key elements.
:::

Markdown documents are usually saved as plain text files with the
extension `.md`, e.g., `report.md`. These allow for an easy way to
create a variety of outputs, particularly reports and text-focused web
pages. The markdown format is *converted* into other formats (html,
latex, etc.) with a variety of tools, particularly something called
Pandoc.

```{block2,  type='note'}
**What is Pandoc?**

Pandoc is a tool (a program) for converting from one document format to another. It is incredibly powerful. The great thing about a format like markdown, or r-markdown, is that it is simple to write and peruse, and, with the help of Pandoc, it can convert into many many other useful formats for web pages, documents, presentations, etc.

Pandoc is built into other tools including the RMarkdown package (see discussion on [Stackexchange here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40563479/relationship-between-r-markdown-knitr-pandoc-and-bookdown)).

You can also install and use Pandoc directly in the command line, or try it out (in a limited but still useful way) on the web [here](https://pandoc.org/try/)

For more on Pandoc visit [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/)
```

In the R (statistically focused) language there are tools such as
`knitR` that allow R users to produce reports combining text,
statistical output, and interactive content. These are generally written
in "R-markdown" documents, saved as `.Rmd` rather than `.md` files. The
R-studio interface, and several "add-ins", also help facilitate this.
This interface is very useful; in fact, it may be convenient to build
web books and other content using this even if you are not planning to
extensively integrate R code and data. (As in the present book, although
I'm hoping to build this in).

Using R-markdown and Knitr (and other tools and add-ins like 'Bookdown')
content from multiple sources can easily be embedded into these
documents allowing users to easily display objects such as plots or
regression output.

### Some simple markdown rules {#simple-md-rules}

Text can be made *italic* using single asterisks `*italic` or **bold**
by using asterisks `**bold**`.

Hashtags/pound signs (`#`) specify headers and subheaders, e.g., this
third-level subsection header was created with the code:

`### Some simple markdown rules {#simple-md-rules}`

Where the bit in the curly braces allows us to link-back with the code
`[link back text whatever](#simple-md-rules)` ... rendering as [link
back text whatever](#simple-md-rules).

Other key features are ordered lists and unordered lists:

    - unordered first entry
    - unordered second entry
         - subelement of second entry

While basic markdown has a limited set of rules, there are many more
formatting and content options for documents produced in (R)-Markdown,
far too many to detail here. These may combine markdown code, html code,
latex code, and more. The following cheatsheets are very useful for
writing (R)-markdown documents:

Markdown documents allow for an easy way to write reports. Content from
multiple sources can easily be embedded into these documents allowing
users to easily display objects such as plots or tables of data.

::: {.marginnote}
Text can be made *italic* using single asterisks `*italic*` and **bold**
by using double asterisks `**bold**`.
:::

There are various text formatting options in Markdown, far too many to
detail here... The following cheatsheets are very useful for writing
markdown documents:

-   [Markdown
    cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

-   [R Markdown
    cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

\

See also (most useful, but highly detailed):

-   [R markdown - the definitive
    guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

Code chunks provide an easy way to embed code into your R Markdown
files. The code language is not just limited to R either, as other
languages can be used. This means that there is a wide variety of
content which can be displayed in a chunk. Such as tables of data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Code chunks are defined by wrapping text inside ```` ```  ``` ````. The above example was coded using:
````markdown

`r ''````{r}
head(iris)
````

<!-- ````markdown `r ''```` ```` -->

Options can be specified inside of the curly brackets {} More
information is provided
[here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html)

### Inline code

Inline code is a quick and easy way to put snippets of R code. As an
alternative to using code chunks, R code can simply be placed inside of
`` `r ` ``. For example, this can be used as an easy way to insert the
value of a variable into a paragraph without inserting a chunk.

### Latex/maths

R Markdown also can make use of the LaTeX document preparation system,
which is popular for writing technical documents with mathematical
content. This allows us to publish documents which include equations
such as:

$$y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1 +\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_kx_k+u$$

Which is written using
`$$y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1 +\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_kx_k+u.$$`. Using `$$`
means that the equation will be centered on the page. Alternatively `$`
can be used in the same way, without the centering.

[A very useful guide to maths in R
Markdown](https://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/courses/s341/S17/from-class/MathinRmd.html)
provides a detailed outline of the various mathematical symbols which
can be used.

### Custom styles

Bookdown allows for users to build their own custom styles in order to
change the appearance of documents. To create styles for HTML projects a
custom css file is used. For these projects, styles are contained in
[support/tufte_plus.css](support/tufte_plus.css). To use a defined
style, the user can specify options at the start of a chunk, or using a
HTML wrapper as show below for margin notes.

-   More on creating styles
    [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html).
    Below will outline several key styles used throughout these
    projects:

-   **'Notes'**

```{block2, type = 'note'}
Formatted 'Notes' have been defined in this work which allow text to be placed in coloured blocks such as this one. To use this note style, `{block2, type ='note'}` can be specified at the start of the block, or a HTML wrapper can be used. This assigns the .note formatting from the tufte_plus.css file to the chunk.
```

-   **Margin notes** Margin notes are used throughout these projects as
    a way of displaying information in an organised and aesthetically
    pleasing way. To add a margin note, text is placed inside the
    following HTML wrapper:

::: {.marginnote}
The margin notes used in this project are inspired by the Tufte handout
style developed by American statistician Edward Tufte.
:::

```{html}
<div class="marginnote">
Your margin note goes here.
</div>
```

Or margin notes can be added by using chunk options.

-   **Folding boxes**

```{block2, type = 'fold'}
Folding boxes also provide a useful way to incorporate content without cluttering the page. Similarly to the 'notes' the folding boxes are defined in tufte_plus.css and called by specifying `{block2, type='fold'}` at the start of a chunk, or using a HTML wrapper.
```

### Adding references/citations

As with any academic work, it is always important to reference sourced
material. Across these projects the following software is used:

-   **Setup**

Pandoc provides a way to generate formatted references as well as a
bibliography in
[R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

The bibliography file to be sourced is specified within 'YAML' content,
which guides the processing of these documents. (YAML content is
generally enclosed with a three-dash `---` break at top and bottom.)

I generally specify the bibliography source in the YAML at the top of
the .Rmd file, or for Bookdown projects in the the YAML content in
index.Rmd.

<!-- @Oska -- we should try to explain this yaml stuff a bit better. -->

-   **BibTeX**

The BibTeX format refers to a stylized file format which is used
predomoninantly for lists of references, mainly and originally for
working with latex.. BibTeX bibliographies use the .bib extension. For
example the bibliography for this project is
[giving_keywords.bib](support/giving_keywords.bib). For more information
on BibTeX see [here](http://www.bibtex.org/)

-   **Zotero**

Zotero is a free open source reference manager, which enables users to
sync their library of references across multiple devices. Similarly to
other reference managers, Zotero offers plugins for popular browsers
such as Chrome and Safari. This project makes use of a shared reference
library in Zotero, contact daaronr AT gmail.com to be added. [Download
Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/)

-   **Better BibTeX for Zotero**

Better BibTeX for Zotero is a add-on for Zotero. Among other things it
allows the Zotero library to be exported from Zotero for use in
Markdown. Installation instructions are provided
[here.](http://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)

-   **Citr package (addin) for RStudio**

The Citr package provides functions to search Zotero and BibTeX
libraries in order to insert references into Markdown files. Citr also
features a plugin for RStudio which makes the referencing process even
easier. Instructions for download, as well as a demonstration of the
Rstudio plugin are provided
[here.](https://github.com/crsh/citr/blob/master/README.md) When using
the Citr package to add citations to projects such as this one, make
sure to have Citr update the correct Bibtex file.

![Citr Settings for Ea_giving_barriers](picsfigs/citr_settings.png)

::: {.marginnote}
The Bibtex file to "Add references to" is the bibliography file
specified in the YAML header of index.Rmd.
:::

### Specific system for adding references in this project

**Method 1 (recommended): Rstudio citr plugin linked to Zotero**

1.  Install Zotero software, Rstudio, and `citr` package (an 'Add-in').
    Make sure all are running.

2.  Join the Zotero
    [reinstein_research_and_impact_collabs](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2492098/reinstein_research_and_impact_collabs)
    group

3.  Make sure the [group
    library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2492098/reinstein_research_and_impact_collabs/library)
    is syncronised with your Zotero

4.  R-Studio 'Addins (see bar at top)', (Citr) 'insert citation',
    settings (brings up the screen shown above)

-   Make sure 'add references to' specifies the
    "...`ea_giving_barriers/support/reinstein_bibtex.bib`" folder.

-   Make sure Zotero 'reinstein_research_and_impact_collabs' library is
    loaded

5.  Try to add the citation/reference.

-   Note that `[@reference]` gives a different format than `@reference`
    (see below test).

-   If the reference is not present, add it to the Zotero library (there
    are various methods, from Google Scholar etc) and synchronise your
    library, and try it again.

-   If you are not sure what the reference is, consult the Airtable, use
    context, and consult other survey papers. If you are still not sure
    ask on Github.

\

**Method 2: Dropbox-syncronised Zotero to bibtex**

(I'll explain this later)

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

**Adding a shortcut key for 'insert citations' in R-Studio**

You may be able to save time in adding citations (via the CitR add-in in R-Studio) if you use a shortcut key.

Select (menu bar):
  
- Tools
- Addins
- Browse addins

Click in box "keyboard shortcuts"
  
Click the addin "Insert Citations" under 'shortcuts', and enter a keyboard shortcut of your choice.

```

### A test of adding references

*Test a reference from reinstein_bibtex.bib:*
@fongTruthGivingExperimental2010 no brackets
[@fongTruthGivingExperimental2010] with brackets

using an "ID"" only: [@Fong2010]\

## How to 'build' and view the book

**One way is within RStudio**

-   Be sure Github repo is synced so all files are present

-   Packages need to be installed, but this should (?) be done
    automatically when you build via the
    `source(here("code", "baseoptions.R"))` line in index.Rmd

    -   knitr is a key package

-   Click 'Build', 'Build all', or the shortcut key shift-cmd-b

    -   ... this seems to run the command
        `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')`

Building may take some time, depending on how much code is present in
the Rmd files and what that code does

-   It puts all the Rmd files specified in the \_bookdown.yml into a
    single file, here labeled barriers-to-effective-giving.knit.md (I
    think), and then turns that into html, also invoking bibtex along
    the way

-   Depending on your RStudio settings (-Tools, -Project Options, -Build
    tools, -Preview book after building), it may put up a 'preview
    version' of the site. Sometimes an error will appear such as
    "some/file not found", this can typically be bypassed by clicking
    **open in browser**.

-   All the 'new' output is directed to be put in the 'docs' folder, a
    bunch of html files. You can view those 'local' files in any web
    browser

-   Once you commit and push, the 'new' bookdown website should be up on
    the WWW

### Exporting Rmarkdown to Google Docs/Drive

Suppose that we wish to share our work with collaborators who aren't
familiar with Github or Rmarkdown. In this case we may find it useful to
export work to Google Drive. This process is easy in R as we can use the
[googledrive package](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) and [markdrive
packages](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/markdrive). Below we will
outline a basic workflow for rendering Rmarkdown and uploading these
files to Google Drive. During this process files are rendered and converted to Google Docs.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(markdrive)

# Render and upload Rmarkdown file
gdoc_render(filename="sections/barriers_old_classification.Rmd", 
            gdoc_name= "A test",
            gdoc_path= "Test folder")
```

In the above example we render an Rmarkdown document to HTML and upload
the corresponding document to Google Drive. This process tends to work
best with Rmd files with *html_document* output.

One drawback of this method is that rendering and uploading files
multiple times will result in *multiple* files. That is, duplicate files
are not identified and removed automatically. This is possible when
uploading files to Google Drive using the `googledrive` package,
however, due to the need to render and convert our Rmarkdown file
we must make use of the `markdrive` commands which do not support this. We now
consider a workflow which identifies existing files and moves these to
trash. This ensures that we do not create duplicates when uploading.

**Warning**: Make sure that you **do not** already have files with duplicate labels inside your `gdoc_path`. Otherwise these files will be deleted.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(googledrive)
library(markdrive)

# Define files and folders for simplicity
gdoc_file <- "A test"
gdoc_path <- "Term 2"
local_file <- "test.Rmd"

# Check if our file to upload exists already
# If so move this file to trash
if (gdoc_file %in% drive_ls(path=gdoc_path)$name) {
  drive_trash(as_dribble(paste(gdoc_path, gdoc_file, sep="/")))
}

# Render and upload Rmarkdown file
gdoc_render(filename= local_file, 
            gdoc_name= gdoc_file,
            gdoc_path= gdoc_path)
```

## Joining this project

-   Get a Github account, contact daaronr AT gmail.com and tell him your
    github account ID (or the email you used to join should probably
    work as well)

-   Remember to 'accept' the invitation to the repos (here, the
    EA_giving_barriers repo; and possibly some other supporting repos as
    well). You should receive this invitations via email and it should
    also be in your "notifications" on Github.

### Creating a Branch and a 'pull request'

### GitHub web page content {\#}

As noted, GitHub is a web page and interface that acts as an external
server and storage space for git projects/repos. It works well with this
and also incorporate several additional features. You can see it and
even interact with much of a repo simply via the GitHub webpage without
even installing Git (but I strongly recommend that you do install Git as
well as a tool like GitHub Desktop, unless you want to solely rely on
command line Git).

#### Web page for a repo {.unnumbered}

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='EA barriers repo github starting page'}

knitr::include_graphics('picsfigs/ea_barriers_github_repo_startpage.png')

```

In your account when you click on the repo you'll see something like the
screen above. There are many tabs, starting with the code tab. At the
top of this, you will see the list of folders and files, with messages
describing the latest comments.

::: {.marginnote}
Once you've installed Git you will want to 'clone this repo' to have it
on your machine and to be able to easily work with it and commit and
push and pull changes. You will do this clone either via the web site,
GitHub Desktop or another application, or using the command line
:::

Note here we also see:

-   48 'commits'

-   2 'branches'

-   2 contributors

Below this, some options allowing you to switch branch, manually upload
files, clone or download etc.

#### Readme for a repo {.unnumbered}

Below the list of files you should see the "readme" for this repository.
This is a file 'README.md' stored in the root directory of this
repository. If you click on it or look at the file you'll see it is
written in markdown syntax but the GitHub website renders it into a nice
format.

I typically use this readme to explain what the project is about and
describe (and link) the folder structure.

#### Comments/notifications {.unnumbered}

In a variety of places within a repo when you are adding comments or
content you can refer to a collaborator who will then receive a
"notification" linking this content. (These are also called "callouts"
in some systems.) These may come as as emails to that collaborator if
they set a setting to get email notifications, but they will definitely
appear as a notification, again that bell thing in the upper right hand
corner.

#### Seeing recent commits, history and 'blame' {.unnumbered}

![Showing the most recent commits](picsfigs/some_commits.png)

\

Above, this shows the most recent commits.

Clicking on one of these commits will show you 'what changed' and old
versus new versions.

\

![Showing the most recent commits](picsfigs/commit_some_diffs.png)

For example, above we see something like a "split diff" view, with the
'old version' (before this commit) on the left and the 'new version' on
the right. What is new is in green (with a '+'), and what is removed is
in red highlight (with a "-").

Here we see that ...

-   in the file 'sections/inertia.rmd' a space has been added after
    'crowding out?'

    ::: {.marginnote}
    This is but one way to view and consider changes. Various text
    editors such as Atom and ViM also offer great tools, as does the Git
    program itself and the GitHub desktop application.
    :::

-   in 'present_puzzle.Rmd' an (obsolete) 'underline' notation has been
    replaced with a third level markdown header (three `#` marks)

#### Commenting within commits, etc., tagging collaborators in this {.unnumbered}

One way to ask questions, comment on changes and let people know about
changes you made, is via adding a comment within a commit itself.
(Check: can this be tied to an 'issue'?)

![Commenting on a part of a commit, notifying a
collaborator](picsfigs/commenting_a_commit.png)

Above, we see that by clicking on a plus sign that appears just to the
right of the the line number when viewing a commit, we can add a comment
on that particular part of the commit. We can then flag another
collaborator (see '\@daaronr' above ... when you type the '\@' you get a
dropdown of collaborators) who will be notified of this.

This mode of commenting and conversation has the advantage of avoiding
cluttering up the actual code and text with excess comments.

\

You can also link each comment to an 'issue' (issues are discussed
below) by adding a hash to the comment and citing the issue number. This
comment and link to the place in the code or text for that commit will
then show up when you look at that issue. This makes the discussion more
organized, at least we hope.

![Link an issue in a comment](picsfigs/comment_link_issue.png)

#### The 'Project' board and 'Issues' {.unnumbered}

```{block2,  type='note'}

I discuss these features in  a video guide  [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kxa174tw6psno4s/git-github-commit-policy-theory-project.mp4?dl=0) starting at about 11:46.

Note that the 'project board' and 'issues' are just tools on the Github web site for discussing and managing the project; these are not files or data, it's a built-in tool.


```

-   the Project is a 'Kanban board' for managing tasks, responsibilities
    and progress

-   these should be entered as 'issues', enabling assignments and
    further discussion within the 'issues' pages

## Airtable and innovationsinfundraising.org

This project is closely connected to
[innovationsinfundraising.org](innovationsinfundraising.org). Much of
these projects overlap, and there is a shared 'database' stored as an
airtable [Giving researchers
shared](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invjWg63fpQAOBcch&inviteToken=0b154f62460aba428e0bf8c082ae3947e2e9b62b1045994a767eee551bb92833)

We had an earlier ... [tutorial on using the Airtable and
Innovationsinfundraising.org
here](https://github.com/daaronr/ea_giving_barriers/blob/master/documentatiion_and_tutorials/project_airtableexplained/airtable_database_overview.pdf)

I add a few more points below, more relevant to the current project:\

### Airtable {.unnumbered}

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a collaborative web-based software
with a variety of displays and organizational structures; it has many
features of a relational database, and even more features if one engages
their API. It is user-friendly, with a gui resembling a spreadsheet, and
easy tutorials, instructions and examples. You can operate it from a
browser or a web-driven app.

### Key features of tables in Airtables (quick views) {.unnumbered}

Each Airtable user can have any number of *Bases*, and bases can be
shared in work groups.

-   Command-K to jump to any other Base

"key_papers"; the papers providing the most relevant and strongest
evidence for the tool, and "secondary papers".

### Key content {.unnumbered}

The "Categories" table provides and explains a number of "schema" we use
to characterize both the tools and the "Barriers to effective giving"
(discussed later).

![categories table](picsfigs/categories_table.png)

\

Key papers are stored and organised in the 'papers_mass' table. This is
crosslinked in several other tables. Within each paper 'row' there is a
variety of relevant information and discussion on each paper.

![key papers](picsfigs/key_papers.png)

\

The fundingwiki app automatically populates and updates information on
the number of times each paper has been cited, using the Crossref
database. Tool such as these will enable this to be a perrennial
resource, rather than a frozen-in-time evaluation.

![citations auto update](picsfigs/citations_auto_update.png)

\

```{block2,  type='note'}
**Note**: Some but not all of the Airtable content discussed in the rest of this subsection has already been incorporated into the present bookdown.

```

The table "EAlit_sections" outlines the (earlier?) structure of the EA
barriers paper, already providing links to information that will be
integrated.

![organizing ealitpaper](picsfigs/organizing_ealitpaper.png)

This table also links directly to the papers_mass table, organizing the
papers we are referencing and reviewing in each section.

![organizing EAlit papers](picsfigs/organizing_EAlit_papers.png)

\

The separate "Barriers to EAG" table is below.

This organizes and assembles the discussion and evidence on potential
factors and categories of factors that may explain the limited amount of
"effective giving". This represents the largest part of our review
paper; we focus on clear definitions of the most relevant psychological
(and "behavioral economic") biases, and carefully asses the available
evidence. We focus specifically on evidence in the charitable domain,
but we also consider the broader evidence for these biases in other
contexts.

![barriers to EAG](picsfigs/barriers_to_EAG.png)

::: {.marginnote}
Again, this is older work, maybe already incorporated into the Bookdown?
:::

For each barrier or bias, we consider why it is may be particularly
relevant to *effective* giving.

![barriers to EAG, why
relevant](picsfigs/barriers_to_EAG_whyrelevant.png)

\

We further propose and discuss tools addressing these barriers and
promoting effective charitable giving.

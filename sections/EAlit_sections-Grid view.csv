Explaining the puzzle; barriers to EA giving and potential responses,david reinstein,"Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another... when and how? This is critical to understanding  the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch'  from other charities. To the extent this is the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressure you to give to local orgs) themselves represent barriers to EA giving (see below).

-  Misinformation/lack of awareness (of needs/effectiveness and/or of utilitarian arguments)
- Judgement/cognition failures
- Emotion overrides cognition",,"Conceptual: 
Limitations to processing information and understanding utilitarian maximization etc.
Some biases/factors just move decisions away from effectiveness because they maximize on a different metric
Some biases tend to hurt more effective charities in particular 
These may be conceptualized as result of them being underfunded because of the second point. Nonetheless, we will focus on those biases that have a particular impact given the curent mis-allocation. We pose the thought-experiment/heuristic “(addressing) which biases will have the greatest impact on effective giving?”",,,,,,

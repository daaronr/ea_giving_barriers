# Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving {#present-puzzle}

::: {.marginnote}
Overview of research question/problem: Why don't people give in an evidence-based way?
:::

::: {.marginnote}
For an introduction to the field of effective altruism, see [this article](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) from [effectivealtruism.org](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), as well as [here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/resources/) for an introductory resource list.
:::

**(I) Limited giving to those most in need:** When faced with the ["girl drowning in the pond"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBMZiaD-OYo) we are willing to sacrifice substantial wealth to save a life. However, [most people don't make large donations to the very poor](https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2017-total-charitable-donations-rise-to-new-high-of-390-05-billion/) (see, e.g., @meerGenerosityIncomeWealth2020), in spite of evidence suggesting that lives can be saved [for less than 5,000 USD](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness) in expectation (and people's apparent belief that it is even cheaper).\*

<div class="marginnote">
This does not seem to be for a lack of *overall* generosity. As a prominent example,  US Americans give roughly 2\% of their income to charities (and 'give far more' if we include transfers to children and other family). However, giving mostly goes to local and domestic charities which are far less effective per dollar than the ones recommended GiveWell.org.  G
</div>

**(II) Inefficiency of charitable giving:** There is a strong case that most donations go to charities that improve well-being far less per-dollar than others. The figure below depicts estimates of 'cost per additional disease-adjusted-life-year ([DALY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year))' from the most promising health interventions.\*\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*\* Many of these interventions have room for more funding from private charity. Even the upper bound of these estimates is routinely below 100 (USD) per DALY.

In contrast, charity-supported interventions such as providing guide dogs for the blind routinely cost over 5000 USD per dog per year, presumably yielding substantially less than a single DALY of benefit per year. Make-a-Wish 'wishes' for dying children [cost over 11,000 USD on average](https://wish.org/faq#:~:text=to%20the%20top%20%5E-,How%20much%20does%20granting%20a%20wish%20cost%3F,of%20a%20wish%20was%20%2411%2C161); the same money may be able to *save* as many as three children's lives (on average) if devoted to (e.g.) [seasonal preventative anti-malarial drugs](https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium).\*

:::

<!-- Another costly example ... around 50k per DALY -- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402472/ -->

In general, most charitable giving goes towards helping people in *wealthier* countries,\* even though it is widely accepted that far more lives can be saved and improved when funds are devoted towards more effective interventions in poor countries (see fold).

::: {.marginnote}
\* See, e.g., evidence from a US nationally representative survey (self-reports) in @Reinstein2011a, or lists of the most popular charities in wealthy countries, e.g., [this YouGov poll for the UK.](https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/politics/popularity/charities-organisations/all)
:::

```{block2,  type='fold'}

> This range of cost-effectiveness values draws from the growing literature on health care opportunity costs, which suggests that a figure approximating half of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted is a realistic level of willingness-to-pay for health care interventions in [low to middle income countries] (Ochalek, Lomas, and Claxton 2015), cited in [@bundy2017], chapter 3, page 48.

Similar calculations referring to the value of a statistical life as being proportional to GDP per capita are found throughout this volume and beyond. E.g., (a random example) [@cobiac2012] considers "a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 AUSD/DALY" (just a bit below their GDP per capita in 2012.).

As of 2021 the IMF reported ([wikipedia link, accessed 20 May 2021]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP\_(nominal)\_per_capita\#cite_note-GDP_IMF-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita#cite_note-GDP_IMF-4)) a GDP-per-capita of over 60,000 USD in the wealthiest countries like the United States and Australia, and under 550 USD in the poorest countries, such as Madagascar and Mozambique, a ratio of roughly 100 to 1.

```

As @burumEvolutionaryExplanationIneffective2020 state: "We donate billions of dollars to charities each year, yet much of our giving is ineffective. Why are we motivated to give, but not motivated to give effectively?"

The above points (I) and (II) raises two related questions:

**I. "Why don't we give more to the most effective charities and to those most in need?",** and

**II. "Why are we not more efficient with our giving choices?"**

To address this, we must understand what drives giving choices, and how people react to the presentation of charity-effectiveness information.\*

::: {.marginnote}
\*Note that these two questions are not identical: the first asks about the amounts given to the most needy charities, and the second about the choice of charities conditional on giving.
:::

## Motivation and descriptives {#motivate-puzzle}

Individual donors, governments and firms demonstrate substantial generosity (e.g., UK charity represents 0.5-1% of GDP, US charity around 2% of GDP).\*\*

::: {.marginnote}
\*\*[@CAFWorldGiving; @CharitableGivingTops]
:::

However, most donations go towards charities that are worthwhile but improve human well-being far less per dollar than basic medical interventions in poor countries, such as antimalarial bednets (see [Givewell.org](http://givewell.org)). Even within the same category, more can be achieved for less: e.g. while it costs around USD 50,000 to provide a blind person a guide dog, the equivalent amount may be able to be used to prevent many cases of visual impairment from trachoma for many people [@burton2009global] through preventative measures and surgery, perhaps [more than 50](https://blog.givewell.org/2009/01/30/surgeries-performed-vs-cases-of-blindness-prevented/).\*

::: {.marginnote}
\* The latter figure is an extrapolation from the more conservative estimates in the Givewell Blog. Note that while the effectiveness of the trachoma interventions seem to have been [overstated in the past](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ/fact-checking-comparison-between-trachoma-surgeries-and) by Peter Singer and others. Still, they appear to be at least an order of magnitude more effective at prevventing harm from blindness as do guide dogs.
:::


Social science, biology and philosophy present a range of potential theoretical explanations of how values, preferences, and biases drive this 'inefficient altruism'. However, evidence (e.g., for 'availability bias', or for 'scope insensitivity') comes largely from small-scale experiments in domains outside of charitable-giving. It is difficult to distinguish robust, credible findings from one-off results that are vulnerable to hype, p-hacking and publication bias (echoing the 'replication crisis' in experimental social science [@shrout2018psychology]). Given the limited, scattered findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors substantially impact 'effective giving and support for policies that reduce extreme poverty'. (We give a review of papers surveying this evidence [below](#prevsurvey).)

<!-- TODO: Reference survey articles for the above -->

A plain-language summary of key points, without references (unfold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

**Charities’ impact differs by an order of magnitude:** Some charities are much more effective at saving/improving lives (and achieving other goals such as those involving animals and the environment) than others are. While it is difficult to gain precise estimate on the measures such as “cost of a life saved” there is strong evidence that there are orders of magnitude difference between different categories of charities and different interventions within these categories.

**There are some very effective lifesaving charities:** Some interventions seem likely to save or vastly improve individual lives at a cost in the range of USD 2000 -  USD 10,000. When people are asked whether they would be willing to spend this amount or even a vastly larger amount to save a life in other contexts they typically will agree to do so.

**There are two related and largely unresolved puzzles:**

1. Why are people not more generous with the most highly effective causes? and

2. When they give to charity why do they not choose more effective charities?

**There is some evidence on this but it is far from definitive.** We do not expect there to be only a single answer to these questions; there may be a set of beliefs, biases, preferences, and underlying circumstances driving this. We would like to understand which of these are robustly supported by the evidence, and will have a sense of how important each of these are in terms of the magnitude of driving and absence of effective giving. There has been only a limited amount of research into this and it has not been systematic, coordinated, nor heavily funded.

**We seek to understand because we believe that there is potential to change attitudes, beliefs, and actions** (primarily charitable giving, but also  political and voting behaviour and workplace/career choices). Different charitable appeals, information interventions and approaches may substantially change peoples charity choices. We see potential for changing the “domain” of causes chosen (e.g., international versus US domestic) as well as  the effectiveness of the charities chosen within these categories. (However, we have some disagreement over the relative potential for either of these.)

Our main ‘policy’ audience includes both effective nonprofit organisations and ‘effective altruists’. The EA movement is highly-motivated, growing, and gaining funding. However, it represents a niche audience: the ‘hyper-analytic but morally-scrupulous’. EA organisations have focused on identifying effective causes and career paths, but have pursued neither extensive outreach nor ‘market research’ on a larger audience (see [Charity Science](http://www.charityscience.com/operations-details/scaling-down-charity-science-outreach), [Gates Foundation/Ideas42](http://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ideas42-Best-of-Intentions_Charitable-Giving-1.pdf)).

## (Lack of) previous synthesis on this {#prevsurvey}

There have been some relevant prior reviews, such as [Caviola et al, 2021](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(21)00090-5#secst0005)).\*

::: {.marginnote}
There has also been some unpublished or non-academic work: 'Behavior and Charitable Giving' (Ideas42, 2016), 'Charitable Fundraising And Smart Giving' (Gertler, 2015), and 'The Psychology of Effective Altruism' (Miller, 2016, slides only).
:::

However, the current project uniquely\*\* combines (or at least, aims to combine)

i.  A focus on effectiveness,

ii. considering 'choices among charities' as well as in isolation,

iii. incorporating recent work and developments from the 'EA movement',

iv. a rigorous, sceptical approach to evidence, and

v.  advancing a research agenda while building tools that promote robust evidence.

\

<div class="marginnote">

\*\* @greenhalghSystematicReviewBarriers2020 performed 'a systematic review of the barriers to and facilitators of the use of evidence by philanthropists when determining which charities (including health charities or programmes) to funds' using PRISMA guidelines.

However, their approach is distinct. They seem not to focus on psychological barriers, they focus more on large philanthropists and foundations, and they put greater weight on qualitative work and self-reports than we do here.

I intend to look more closely at how they identified these studies, how they eliminated studies from consideration, and why many of the studies we discuss in the current project were not found or were excluded.

@caviola2020many is highly relevant and insightful (and has some connection to the structure we present below). From their abstract:

> We review the motivational and epistemic causes of (in)effective giving. Many donors view charitable giving as a matter of personal preference, which favors decisions based on emotional appeal rather than effectiveness. In addition, while many donors are motivated to give effectively, they often have misconceptions and cognitive biases that reduce effective giving.

Still, Caviola et al does not drill deeply into the strength of the evidence and the relative importance of each factor. However, this may stem from a small amount of available evidence to survey. Ideas42 (ibid) wrote:

> We did not find many field-based, experimental studies on the factors that encourage people to choose thoughtfully among charities or to plan ahead to give.

## Definitions - "Efficiency" versus impact {#def-impact}

::: {.marginnote}
Consider: The measures used are relevant to how we consider issues such as charity 'quality ratings' and 'overhead aversion.'

Reference: Steinberg & Morris, 2010 wrote about marginal vs average effectiveness.
:::

It is important to define the concept of talking about. What, precisely, is this 'effectiveness' or 'impact' of a charity we are focusing on? It is not trivial to get this right and there are some delicate and hotly debated questions even within the EA movement. Nonetheless, I sketch the basic idea in the math below.

*Aside: 'but what about uncertainty?*

::: {.marginnote}
Thanks to Jason Schukraft for bringing up this point.
:::

```{block2,  type='fold'}
\* This discussion abstracts away from issues of empirical uncertainty. We obviously cannot be certain state of the world 'with or without' one's charitable giving. This we cannot be certain about the *impact* of a particular charitable gift. I aim to return to this issue in later sections. Both empirical and 'moral uncertainty' have been carefully considered by academic philosophers and the EA community (e.g., at the Global Priorities Institute).

For the sake of the discussion below, we might assume that either:

- donors essentially only care about the *expected value* consequences of their choices *or*
- to the extent that their is uncertainty over the 'impact' of donations and interventions, this uncertainty is similar across causes.

```

$G_j$: The total donations given to charity $j$ during some interval; i.e., the charity's income.

$B_j(G_j)$: A function defining the beneficial *outcome* achieved by charity $j$ with the total donations $G_j$.

Here, we are referring to $B_j(G_j)$ as (the improvement to) some *ultimate outcome*: Lives saved (i.e., deaths averted), quality adjusted life years (QALY) added, QALY weighted by age, Disease-adjusted (DALY), future happy lives generated, sentient suffering averted, etc.

::: {.marginnote}
As noted, there are disagreements over how and whether we should trade off among these outcomes. Issues such as population ethics, and the importance of sentience and experience --- come to the fore. We will ignore these for now.
:::

The important distinction here: $B(G_j)$ does not refer to a simple intermediate *'output'* such as 'antimalarial nets provided' nor 'textbooks purchased'. We are referring to the social *outcome* of ultimate value; an outcome that could be valued in and of itself.

This naturally takes into account *both* the 'technical efficiency' in terms of how many units of output can be produced per dollar, and the rate at which each unit of this output boosts the ultimate outcomes of interest.

\

```{block2,  type='note'}

The 'production function' is (perhaps tautologically) the product of two terms:

(Total or marginal) impact per dollar = output per dollar $\times$ impact per output
```

::: {.marginnote}
This is obviously an oversimplification. To achieve the beneficial outcome the charity will require many intermediate inputs (or "outputs" as noted above), including 'management' and 'careful targetting of programs'. Some charities may be able to acquire these inputs at better prices than others, and some may also use a more efficient mix of inputs.
:::

\

A donor may care about the 'impact' of her own donation; i.e., she may want to know the difference in outcomes that her donation achieves everything else equal. In other words, the difference in the ultimate outcome in a world with versus without her donation.

**Small donor assumption**: For a small donor (perhaps someone who donates less than USD 100,000), we may assume that this "rate of benefit" will be the same for both the first and the last dollar she donates.

::: {.marginnote}
See [this talk/article](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/prospecting-for-gold-owen-cotton-barratt/) from Owen Cotton-Barratt for more on some key economic effective altruist concepts, including heavy tailed distributions, diminishing marginal returns and comparative advantage
:::

<!-- TODO -- how to tag and refer to assumptions and equations in R markdown? -->

Thus we consider the *marginal* impact, as a simplification:

$B_j^\prime (G_j)$ for the marginal donor.

I assert that $B_j^\prime(G_j)$ is the quantity that GiveWell (and perhaps other EA charity raters) are attempting to measure.

\

##### *We know (evidence cited in fold):* {#evidence_eff .unnumbered}

```{block2,  type='fold'}

There is abundant evidence for order-of-magnitude difference in the effectiveness of charities, and the most popular ones are far from the most effective. Some further links and references:

Ord, T. (2013, March 12). "The moral imperative toward cost-effectiveness in global health. Center for Global Development." Retrieved from www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/142701.

["Your dollar goes farther overseas"](http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas) (Givewell, 2016).

```

$B_j^\prime(G_j)$ is much larger for the most *impactful* relative to the most *popular* charities.

\

Increased benefits could be achieved if donations were "reallocated" towards more impactful charities. An individual who gains value from her giving through it's *impact* alone would naturally donate to only the *one* charity that has the greatest marginal impact, the charity $j$ with the greatest $B_j'(G_j)$ term. If every donor is doing this, then as an 'equilibrium' result, *every charity receiving positive donations should have the same last-dollar marginal impact.* In maths:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}

B_k^\prime(G_k) = B_j^\prime(G_j)\forall j,k s.t. G_j>0, G_k>0
\end{equation}
```
Caveats (unfold):

```{block2,  type='fold'}

This assumes a single impact goal, essentially 'cause neutrality'.

The idea that each donor gives only to a single charity essentially depends on the above 'Small donor assumption'. Still, allowing that the marginal-benefit-leading-charity may vary within the range of an individuals' donation simply implies that they should allocate among multiple charities each up to the point that the last dollar given yields the same marginal benefit as the other charities, yielding the above result. We can imagine an equilibrium in which all donors give to multiple charities, with each of these charities being virtually "tied" in their marginal effectiveness.


See also this brief (EA Forum) on the ["Market efficiency of philanthropy"](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/market-efficiency-of-philanthropy). I hope to extend the discussion here, considering the  'efficient market hypothesis' applied to charitable donations, and the limitations of this.

```

\

But we do *not* seem to be doing this. Again: billions are given to charity, and these charities clearly have vastly different marginal impacts, even among those that seem to target very similar outcomes.

<!-- TODO:  many of the above arguments have probably been  made much more  carefully and completely both in Economics papers and in places like the EA Forum; draw and cite more from these -->

## Why (under which models) is this a puzzle? {#why-puzzle}

Does the set of facts mentioned above constitute a "puzzle" for our Economics and Psychology models, or are there obvious existing explanations? In Economics terms, are donors mysteriously ''leaving money on the table'' or are they simply optimizing given their their preferences and constraints? What could explain this?

*We return to this in the [next section](barriers-breakdown), while classifying potential 'barriers' to effective giving*.

::: {.marginnote}
Economists love when we can say that something is officially a *Puzzle*. It is an achievement in itself to be the researcher who first discovered a *Puzzle*, even if we have no clue how to resolve it.
:::

### Aside: Economic models of giving\* {#econ-models}

::: {.marginnote}
'\* I return to this discussion in section \@ref(subst-framework)
:::

Traditionally, economic models are essentially 'if then' exercises meant to illustrate what factors *might* be driving outcomes, perhaps facilitating empirical testing. They are not, in general, *claims* about people's preferences, how they behave, or what motivates them. The discussion of charity in the Economics literature has tended to focus on two extreme models, focusing on modeling assumptions that allow simple mathematical 'if-then' proofs. Most of these models involve an individual making choices between a private good and a homogenous charitable good so as to maximizing a "utility function" (value function), subject to their budget constraints

1.  A adaptation of the '**Public goods model**' (often attributed to @becker1974) in which individuals care about the total amount of a charitable good provided (no matter who contributes it), either because it benefits them directly or because they care about other people. (The utility of others might be subsumed into one's own utility function). This is sometimes labeled (confusingly in my opinion) called "pure altruism".

2.  An extreme representation of a '**Warm glow'** model [@andreoni1989giving] in which an individual's utility increases (presumably at a decreasing rate) in the 'amount they sacrifice' towards the charitable good.

It is also important to note that the 'warm glow' presented in the Economics literature does not map to only a single psychological mechanism or theory; it maps to many such mechanisms. There is some ambiguity as to which motivations should be subsumed in this 'warm glow'. According to Andreoni (who coined the term):

> The concept of warm-glow is only a convenient reduced-form representation for deeper and more complex considerations of givers [@andreoni2006]

In fact, each of the above models is an extreme representation that was originally used to provide insight into how to think about issues such as "does government spending crowd-out private donations" and "how do individuals respond to tax-benefits for giving"? In its simplest form, each model yields predictions that are profoundly unrealistic and can easily be "rejected" by real world data.

Much is left ambiguous in each model, as well as in other fairly prominent models such as the "Impact" [@duncan2004] or "Identification" [@atkinson2009] models of giving, or reputation-based models [@harbaugh1998]

\

*For the present discussion, our focus, in considering these models, is:*

(When and how) does the "actual impact of one's gift" have an impact

-   into the 'good feeling' one gets from giving

-   or the thing the individual is maximizing

... in a way that drives donation choices?

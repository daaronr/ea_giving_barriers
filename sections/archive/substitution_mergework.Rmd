## Previous approaches and evidence


::: {.marginnote}
The material in this section largely overlaps the literature review in Reinstein, Reiner and Vance-McMullen 202 ongoing, in the repository <https://github.com/gerhardriener/CharitySubstitutionExperiment/>, in the file lit-synth.Rmd

These should be integrated with one another.

Observation of this 'crowding out' is difficult. There is a **lack of data**  on donations at the individual-charity level; available data typically considers total individual giving in a year (especially via tax records),  asks people to recall their recent donations, sometimes broadly differentiated by cause but not by specific charity (see, e.g., [@wilhelmNewDataCharitable2006]). There is also data on charity's total revenues (reported to the government as well as independent surveys),  and data on giving through specific platforms. However, there is no source of data on an individual's lifetime giving broken down across modes and specific charities.

For identification: Lack of **independent observable variation** in price, shocks, or appeals.

**Intertemporal substitution** is an issue, and we typically **cannot observe 'lifetime giving.'**

Even defining this issue is a challenge. Estimation of 'Expenditure substitution' [@reinsteinDoesOneCharitable] is complicated by issues of extensive vs intensive margins, as well as heterogeneity.

### Observational work

**Observational data** typically lacks shocks that are clearly *specific* to giving to one charity. Observational data on charitable giving (e.g., survey data or tax data) offers few variables that can be used to identify 'specific' shocks -- shocks that alter giving to one charity but have no independent effect on giving to other charities. Most observable variables that are believed to increase giving to one charity will also increase giving to other charities, masking substitution effects.


#### Signing-the-bias approach {.unnumbered}


@reinsteinDoesOneCharitable using PSID/COPPS data finds some evidence of expenditure substitution, especially for large givers.

**Results, "bounding below" argument:**

- He finds many negative significant correlations between residuals from fixed-effects regressions on donations to categories of charitable causes.
    - This especially holds for larger (prior) donors and for certain paired cause categories.

Under what he argues to be plausible econometric assumptions (essentially, net positive correlations between the residuals of 'propensity to donate to each cause') implies that negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution.

\
**Interpretation:** He interprets these in terms of 'heterogeneous motivations for giving', arguing that large givers are more likely to have a sophisticated optimization over charities incorporating diminishing returns to each cause, and small givers more likely to be responding to temporary shocks and appeals.

\

**Limitations:** Even if one accepts the bounding assumptions, t hese findings are limited, even as a bounded result. The data is recall data, and charitable categories are not well defined in the PSID data; respondents may categorize the same donations into different groupings.


#### Observational data paired with 'exogenous' shocks {.unnumbered}

@Deryugina2015**:**

**Results and interpretation:

Donations in a state affected by tornado increase 1.7-2 percent in that year and 1.9-2 percent in the 2 years after. The authors can only reject 'full crowding out'.

\

@scharfLiftShiftEffect2017:

These authors observe "CAF accounts"; for this particular group, they observe all donations over a substantial period.

*Author's conclusions:*

-   They reject 'full crowd-out'. They find a 'tight zero' long-run crowdout.

-   Non-disaster giving is pre-poned (!), especially for disaster/intl donors; they argue this is a "halo effect?"

\

Estimates: +.537 log donations to DEC-13, se .032; -0.008 log donations to 'other charities', se 0.017 $\rightarrow$

\

*Their interpretation...*

> Consistent with... for (only) people responding to the DEC appeal ... the disaster appeal increased the effectiveness with which donating to all charities, including other charities, produces warm glow utility---a halo effect

They argue that their data allows them to reject the "transactions cost" explanation because they see i. less bunching than usual, ii. shifts in amounts given and not just at the extensive margin and iii. a particular shift from certain categories.

\

*Limitations:*

- Specific CAF population
- disaster-specific context
- time-series variation issues (6 disasters=lumpy?)

Todo: add pictures of the relevant environments for these studies here

### Simultaneous/proximate 'lab' experiments

A range of authors have asked 'economics laboratory' participants to make a sequence of real donation choices.

These include Reinstein (2006/11); @filiz-ozbay and @schmitz2016

*Figures: Berkeley design, types*

Vary choice sets/prices, shocks $\rightarrow$ crowd-out, esp. similar causes

*Figures: Berkeley line graphs*

(Reinstein, 2011) $\rightarrow$ Strong "expenditure substitution" responses to shocks, esp for similar charities; approx 50% crowd-out; 2.59 cross-price-elasticity)

-   Heterogeneity; mix of 'fixed purse', 'flexible purse/never substitute']

\
\

@Filiz-Ozbay2019 : Five paired choices, varying 'rebate rate' for one only; price-focus
   - 'Stealing' almost always
   - +0.35 net cross-price elast for 'substitute' charities

\
\
-   @Harwell; @Schmitz: somewhat related designs, similar results in flavor


### Lab/framed experiments with time gaps

-   @Schmitz2019 (ExpEcon, small time gap)

-   Vance-Mullen component of Reinstein et al

## Field/natural experiments

Notes from previous paper (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

\cite{van2009does} offer some field experimental evidence on the crowding-out effects of direct mail solicitations.

\cite{borgloh} have investigated the impact of the German church tax on households' other charitable giving. \cite{null2011warm} used a field experiment to examine how donations to different charities respond to changes in relative match rates -- however, as the total donation was decided ex-ante, the substitution among charities was constrained to be complete. Finally, an earlier work (\citealp{andreoni1996cct}) examines substitution between giving and volunteering. However, to the best of my knowledge, no work directly addresses the cross-price elasticity (nor the expenditure substitution) between gifts to charitable causes.

2017 paper: Finds increased funding for project, no significant impact on donations to other projects

@Meer2014: "increased competition reduces the likelihood of a project being funded"

-   @Donkers2017: Extra mailings to existing donors in a week, top-NL charities

    -   Extra mailings +1.81 EUR for charity,
    -   -0.10 EUR per 'regular' mailing for *other* charity in *same week*
    -   loss of 10% of revenues via competitive effects
    -   can't reject zero-crowding, but wide CI's

@adenaGivingOnceGiving2019: Anticipated repetition $\rightarrow$ 40% less "this year" (but also a *persistent* lower donation)

@Cairns2011: *Anticipated* \`2nd collection' at Mass raised 7695 USD , reduced 1st collections by 1708 USD (22% "crowdout")


Reinstein et al, 2020: First field-experiment to ask (or not ask) on multiple separate occasions with a significant delay, vary this delay time; find some crowding out but evidence on interaction with delay time is mixed. Possibly two channels: consistency versus fading of moral license/warm glow.

## Synthesis (emerging)

```{r, out.width='85%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Papers on substitution; database'}

knitr::include_graphics('picsfigs/subst_meta_cut.png')

```

"Proximate asks" and "clearly presented comparisons" $\rightarrow$ expected crowding-out

However, the generalizability of this finding is limited by a particular set of issues: apparent contrast, "coherent arbitrariness" [@ariely2003], narrow brackets, framing (how people think they 'should behave' or how they behave when they are in a deliberative self-reflecting mode. This may characterize some giving decisions but it is probably not the most common.

With naturally-occurring, more time-separated shocks and asks, the results are more mixed, sometimes with much smaller, or no apparent substitution.

So "how proximate is proximate"? Evidence is still mixed <!-- (see above discussion on dual channels) -->

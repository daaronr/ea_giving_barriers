# Are charities in competition?  Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? Ask people to give to EA charity 'instead'?

<!-- (Or put in section 2?) -->

Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another... when and how? This is critical to understanding  the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch'  from other charities. To the extent this is the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressure you to give to local orgs) themselves represent barriers to EA giving (see below).

(David Reinstein has a simultaneous research project on this 'expenditure substitution' question.)

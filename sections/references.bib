Our dictators can purchase signals 26 about why the recipients are poor. We find that a third of the dictators are willing to pay money to learn more 27 about their recipient. Dictators who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less- 28 preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers. With endogenous information about 29 recipients, we find that all types of poor recipients are worse off. 30},

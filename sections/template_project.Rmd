David Reinstein (drafted this version) with Nick Fitz and Ari Kagan

## Extended abstract {#abstract}


### Non-technical abstract


Hunger, homelessness, mental and physical illness, environmental degradation: the needs are boundless, but the resources to solve these problems are limited. Even with the best of intentions and impressive generosity (Americans give roughly 2% of their income to charity!), donors often contribute to inefficient charities -- ones that spend more but accomplish less than others that may be competing for the same funds. Each dollar given to the most effective charities (like those rated by [[Givewell.org]{.underline}](http://givewell.org)) benefits greater numbers of people in more significant ways than the least effective ones. However, donors do not always consider "Effective Altruism" (EA) when deciding how much to give and to which organizations.

Academics (in Economics, Psychology, Biology, and Philosophy) have applied a range of theories to explain what drives "inefficient altruism." Evidence comes from a variety of studies, involving surveys, observational work, laboratory experiments, and, where feasible, natural field experiments.[^1] These have not been run as part of a systematic project addressing this issue; goals, contexts, and approaches have varied as opportunities presented. Given the disparate findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors impact effective giving.

## [Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving](#present-puzzle) {-}

Why should you care about this? Descriptives of giving (US, international) and how 'ineffective' it is. Potential global welfare gains to changing 'where we give'. Lack of previous evidence/synthesis

### [Why (under what models) is this a puzzle?](#why-puzzle) {-}

Why (under what models) is this a puzzle? Economics and psych models --> puzzle?   Models where people care about the impact of their gift or just 'amount sacrificed' (naive warm glow). Does impact map into the 'good feeling' from giving, can it do so?

<!-- Economic and psych models conceptualizing this -->

###  [Definitions - "Efficiency" versus impact](#impact-definitions) {-}

Charity 'quality ratings', Overhead aversion



##  Are charities in competition?  Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? Ask people to give to EA charity 'instead'? {-}

<!-- (Or put in section 2?) -->

Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another... when and how? This is critical to understanding  the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch'  from other charities. To the extent this is the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressure you to give to local orgs) themselves represent barriers to EA giving (see below).

(David Reinstein has a simultaneous research project on this 'expenditure substitution' question.)

## 3. Tools for motivating EA giving

### 3a. Psych/behavioral tools; applicability to EA charities


Briefly highlight  those 'tools' that give non-EA an advantage, but focus on the actionable--how EA lessen or flip that advantage. 2. Which tools present particular challenges or opportunities for EA

Recipient's plight as 'loss' vs previous state -, Unconditional gift (Gift exchange) -, "Percentage donations tied to purchases, especially in online auctions -", Give more tomorrow  -, Give if you win -, "Size of ask; Low-ball, 'Legitimation of paltry donation' (LPD/LPC) -", Solicitor characteristics -, Visibility  (of giver), Visibility - Recognition 'to influence others', Visibility - Recognition tiers, Reveal previous donor/donation (also 'info') -

(Kogut & R, '05)	(Caviola ea, '14)

### 3c. innovative proposals

Smeets?, Kellner_EA_2017

### 3d. EA-movement approaches and pitfalls

What has EA tried and how has it worked; evaluate approaches in light of the evidence. Is the movement too 'purist' (e.g., focusing on only the most effective, proven charities instead of those with broader potential appeal but less evidence)?

Charity science

Wiepking2012?

## 4. Conclusion; a research agenda

Need for systematic platforms to study this, systematic experimentation and data sharing among effective/international charities. Platforms available, proposals for particular research projects and approaches.

- Who gives to the *truly* most effective international charities?

- Who is most likely to be convinced, and which arguments/presentations work in the SR and LR, and for whom (heterogeneity)?

- Statistical learning-based analyses

- Practicable techniques in a range of higher-stakes real-world environments

- Replication (and verification), pooled evidence, meta-analysis
    - Context-sensitivity, large SE $\rightarrow$ large samples, statistical learning controls, sharing data

    - Responses to 'obvious contrasts' seem to not reflect between-subject responses"

# Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving {#present-puzzle}

Overview of research Question/Problem: Why don't people give in an evidence-based way?

## Motivation and descriptives {#motivate-puzzle}

Why should you care about this? 

Descriptives of giving (US, international) and how \'ineffective\' it is. 

Who does give effectively? Potential global welfare gains to changing "where we
 give.  Who does give effectively? (or put at bottom?) {ea-depict}

Fitz/Kagan: Understanding Effective Givers: In this study we attempt to understand who is predisposed towards effective giving. After providing a description of the effective giving movement, we measure support for effective giving and measure a wide range of personality traits and demographics that may predict support for effective giving.

 Why (under what models) is this a puzzle? Economics and psych models - puzzle?   Models where people care about the impact of their gift or just 'amount sacrificed' (naive warm glow). Does impact map into the 'good feeling' from giving, can it do so? 

### Conceptual breakdown of 'barriers' (first presentation)

Base values; (non) utilitarian: people are optimising their own X; $\rightarrow$ no puzzle?

Judgement/cognition failures: People try but fail to optimize

Emotion overrides cognition: Brain serves two masters

Systemic factors: It's society's fault, man (and inertia)

(Yoruk, 2016), (Gneezy ea, '14)
yoruk_2016, Gneezy2014	brown_etal_2016, Chhaochharia_Ghosh_08?, Kinsbergen_tolsma_13

#### Are people utilitarian?

#### Judgement/cognition failures; Biases in perceiving impact and in making choices

Cognitive biases: Overweighting and underweighting probabilities, misunderstanding marginality, scope-insensitivity, Opportunity-cost Neglect. etc. Identifiable victims effect. Responses: De-biasing, etc.

@small2007sympathy, @Gneezy2014,	@ein2013giving, @kogut2005identified, @kogut_2005b, @Kinsbergen_tolsma_13


Perfectionism/deontological aversion to 'waste' (or excuse-driven, motivated reasoning), lack of tangibility (giving to a diffuse cause); Percieved lack of transparency, and perceived corruption overseas

"Overhead aversion, Information about recipients' deservingness -, ""Avoid uncertainties/excuses not to give/mental transactions costs


(Gneezy ea, '14), (Fong & O, '10), (Exley, '16b)	(Andreoni ea, '17), (Dellavigna ea, '12)

#### Emotion overrides cognition 

**Presenting analytical/impact information switches off system 1**

Charity effectiveness (info/deliberation) -, Donor's mood (Impacting) - Affect prime -, Evaluation mode -

(Karlan & W, '07), (Kogut & R, '05)	(Small ea, '07), (Drouvelis & G, '16), (Caviola ea, '14)


**Avoiding information, motivated reasoning in processing it**

@andreoni2017avoiding, @Exley2016, @Exley2015, @dellavigna2012,	@Kellner_EA_2017


#### Barriers: Social/geographic distance

(Info enhancing) social closeness of recipient -

?@cuddy_ea_2007,	(Sudhir ea, '16)

#### Barriers: Strong local appeals ('the ask'), social obligations to give locally (and 'crowding out'/moral licencing)

(Meer, '11)

###  Definitions - "Efficiency" versus impact {#impact-definitions}

Charity 'quality ratings',   Overhead aversion



<!--chapter:end:present_puzzle.Rmd-->

## Previous approaches and evidence


There is a **lack of data** on donations at the individual-charity level.

For identification: Lack of **independent observable variation** in price, shocks, or appeals.

**Intertemporal substitution** is an issue, and we typically **cannot observe 'lifetime giving.' **

Estimation of Expenditure substitution is complicated by issues of extensive vs intensive margins, as well as  heterogeneity


### Observational work

- @Reinstein2011Jun - fixed effects, bounding arguments

- With 'exogenous' shocks: @DeryuginaMarx2015

Donations in state affected by tornado increase  1.7-2 percent in that year and 1.9-2 percent in the 2 years after Can only reject 'full crowding out'


@ScharfSmithOttoni-Wilhelm2017


- CAF accounts all donations over substantial period
- Reject 'full crowd-out', tight zero LR crowdout

$\rightarrow$ non-disaster giving pre-poned (!), esp. for disaster/intl donors; "halo effect?"

Estimates: +.537 log donations to DEC-13, se .032; -0.008 log donations to 'other charities', se 0.017 $\rightarrow$  Reject 'full crowd-out', tight zero LR crowdout

*Interpretation...*

consistent with...  for (only) people responding to the DEC appeal ... the disaster appeal increased the effectiveness with which donating to all charities, including Other charities, produces warm glow utility—a halo effect

They argue that their data allows them to reject the transactions cost explanation because they see i.  less bunching than usual, ii. shifts in amounts given and not just at the extensive margin and
iii.  a particular shift from certain categories.
Issues:  Specific CAF population; disaster-specific; time-series variation issues (6 disasters=lumpy?)}


<!--
Todo: add pictures of the relevant environments for these studies here
-->

### Simultaneous/proximate ‘lab’ experiments**

(esp. Reinstein 2006/11; Ozbay-Uler)


*Figures: Berkeley design, types*

Vary choice sets/prices, shocks $\rightarrow$ crowd-out, esp.  similar causes




*Figures: Berkeley line graphs*

(Reinstein, 2011)  $\rightarrow$ Strong "expenditure substitution" responses to shocks, esp for similar charities; approx 50\% crowd-out; 2.59 cross-price-elast)

- Heterogeneity; mix of 'fixed purse', 'flexible purse/never substitute']

Filiz-Ozbay and Uler, 2018 : Five paired choices, varying 'rebate rate' for one only; price-focus
   - 'Stealing' almost always
   - +0.35 net cross-price elast for 'substitute' charities

-  Harwell ea '15; Schmitz '18: somewhat related designs, similar results in flavor



### Lab/framed experiments with time gaps

- Schmitz 2019 (ExpEcon)

- Vance-Mullen component of Reinstein et al

### Field/natural experiments

- Meer 2014, 2017: DonorsChoose.org competition, matching campaigns

2017: Increased funding for project, no significant impact on donations to other projects

Meer 2014: "increased competition reduces the likelihood of a project being funded"



- Donkers et.al. 2017: Extra mailings to existing donors in a week, top-NL charities
  - Extra mailings +1.81 EUR for charity,
  - -0.10 EUR per 'regular' mailing for *other* charity in *same week*
  - loss of 10\% of revenues via competitive effects
  - can't reject zero-crowding, but wide CI's

- Anticipated second asks:  @CairnsSlonim2011,  @AdenaHuck2017

Cairns and Slonim: *Anticipated* `2nd collection' at Mass raised \$7695, reduced 1st collections by \$1708  (22\% "crowdout")

Adena and Huck: Anticipated repetition $\rightarrow$ 40\% less "this year" (but also a *persistent* lower don)


Reinstein et al, 2020: First field-experiment to  Ask (or not ask) on multiple separate occasions with a significant delay, vary this delay time; find some crowding out but evidence on interaction with delay time is mixed. Possibly two channels: consistency versus fading of moral license/warm glow.


## Synthesis (emerging)

```{r, out.width='35%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Papers on substitution; database'}

knitr::include_graphics('picsfigs/subst_meta_cut.png')

```

Proximate asks and clearly presented comparisons $\rightarrow$ expected crowding-out

A particular issue: apparent contrast, **Coherent arbitrariness**, narrow brackets, framing (how people think they ‘should behave’ or how they behave when they are in a deliberative self-reflecting mode. This may characterize some giving decisions but it is probably not the most common.

With naturally-occuring, more time-separated shocks and asks, the results are more mixed, sometimes with much smaller, or no apparent substitution.

So ``how proximate is proximate''? Evidence is still mixed (see above discussion on dual channels)

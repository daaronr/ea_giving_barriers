### Definition

Related Terms include:   Drop in the bucket; mechanisms include "futility thinking" (Unger?), psychosocial numbing, quantitative confusion/innumeracy


<!-- *1-4 sentence description/definition of the barrier* -->

This claim can be summarized as follows: 

(For a given per-dollar impact on the outcome), people are be less
willing to donate towards a cause when the magnitude of the underlying
problem is (framed as) larger. 

Mechanism: Underlying this is the idea that a certain amount of impact (e.g., relieving suffering) is perceived as smaller and thus less valuable when the underlying problem is larger.

*[Definitional issues and disambiguation]{.underline}*

This needs to be distinguished from scope insensitivity. Note that if people are being analytical, they must *care* about scope in order to care about their impact, and thus (mistakenly) react to the perceived lower impact of donating when the needs are much greater. 
PD arguments may also be used as vehicle for motivated reasoning, and thus not be an important driver in itself: E.g., I don't want to donate so I focus on my impact being a share of the overwhelming need (which I might opportunistically define broadly) to conclude that helping is futile.

Note (unfold)...

```{block2,  type='fold'}
[^1]: My thought was that people who do not value saving lives (or are
  in general unwilling to contribute to it or oppose policies spending
  money on foreign aid for some other reason, e.g. prejudice) exercise
  a form of motivated reasoning to justify this (perhaps in a
  nonstandard way). They choose to reason according to the
  'proportional' standard in order to conclude that it is not worth
  mdonating to these causes because 'the scope of the problem is too
  large and they will never be completely solved'. I suggest that
  people apply this reasoning to problems specifically when they do
  not want to take action to address these problems. (In contrast, in
  domains where they do want to make a change, they may use a
  different, more marginal and \'consistent\' sort of reasoning.)
  E.g., (to be stereotypical) imagine a MAGA person who wants to end
  foreign aid because \"Africa will always have endless problems\" but
  who wants to impose restrictions on abortion (even knowing millions
  of abortions will continue to occur) because \"every unborn life
  matters.\"

```

To operationalize this, we need to define what the numerator and denominator represent. For the numerator, an (EA) impact-driven individualist donor might consider of her *own* contribution (per dollar or overall) relative to the size of the need. In contrast, a more collectivist/team-reasoning/communitarian thinker might consider the impact of the *total* expected donation relative to the size of the need. We also need to better define the denominator; how do individuals lump together different groups/problems to define the overall scale of the need, and how sensitive is this to the fundraisers' framing? 
*[Mechanisms]{.underline}*

Fetherstonhaugh et al (1997) highlight "Weber's law": Humans are sensitive to proportional changes/proportional differences in stimuli (loudness, brightness, etc); thus we are less sensitive to small changes relative to a larger baseline. There is evidence this also holds in assessing losses of life. \... the "subjective value of saving the specified number of lives is greater for a smaller tragedy than for a larger one" . 

Baron attributes PD to quantity confusion and classifies this as "contamination by an irrelevant factor"; more generally, this could be seen in terms of *innumeracy*. 

This may lead to a lower willingness to contribute to a problem when the apparent scale (or "denominator") of the problem is larger (e.g., more lives at risk), holding constant the benefit per dollar contributed (cost per life saved). The *perceived* scale of the problem may depend on how it is framed by fundraisers, charities, and the media. However, this may not be completely manipulable: e.g., massive global problems may not be easy to "frame down." 
"Loewenstein and Small (2007) suggested that the PDE is driven by
increased sympathy towards the victims when one can help a large
proportion of the victim reference-group." \-- Erlandsson et al

### EG Relevance

<div class="marginnote">
How this particular barrier proves problematic for effective giving.
</div>

This effect represents a general departure from appropriate assessment of the marginal benefit (per cost) of a particular charity/intervention. Thus this is a general barrier to accurate assessment of effectiveness ergo a barrier to effective giving. 

In addition, it might be argued that more effective interventions (e.g., targeting poor Africans versus US poverty) may tend to address problems that are inherently larger in scale and magnitude. These may be intrinsically harder to "frame down", implying EG will suffer more from this bias.

<div class="marginnote">
Key papers: Summarize findings and key takeaways, Short description of

</div>

**Fetherstonhaugh et al 1997** (notes
[[HERE]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHaF4phpqthCEwwNdgd_QBZp5np0pHwHEJm3U2G1cxA/edit#heading=h.8ax2rgfz70of))

[Methods]{.underline}

Range of hypothetical scenariae and evaluations, within-subject
manipulations only (with clear contrasts), framed as aid/targeting not
charitable donations, standard (mostly Economics) student subject pools.

These authors conducted survey experiments on standard (fairly small
sample?) student participants. They presented a variety of hypothetical
scenariae (e.g., "imagine themselves as a government official of a
small, developing country"\...), asking for ratings, rankings, etc.

\
**Findings**

> Studies 1 and 2 found that an intervention saving a fixed number of
lives was judged significantly more beneficial when fewer lives were at
risk overall. Study 3 found that respondents wanted the minimum number
of lives a medical treatment would have to save to merit a fixed amount
of funding to be much greater for a disease with a larger number of
potential victims than for a disease with a smaller number.


**Evaluation of paper's evidence:*]{.underline}**

Strengths - Reasonably realistic frames, (mostly) consistent results
across a variety of frames

Limitations - Hypothetical, framed, nonrepresentative, and does not
directly address *own* contributions

Within-subject treatments here:

(+) allow estimation of heterogeneous responses,

(+/-) highlight the difference in denominators/proportions, making them
salient; but this might also be expected to be an inhibitor of this
(seemingly non-rational) effect, especially for the Economics-trained
sample

Statistical tests (ANOVA) appear strong and highly significant in most
cases, but further investigation warranted (e.g., pre-registration?
Evidence of specification fishing and MHT?)

[Evaluation of evidence (Study 4):]{.underline}

Strengths - Realistic charity frame, reasonable implementation of
small/large "reference group" frames, outcomes record both
intentional/attitudinal and actual (small) donation measures

Limitations - A choice *among* charities only

Statistical tests -

mechanism]{.underline}**

**Baron, 1997: "Confusion of Relative and Absolute Risk in Valuation"**

[Methods]{.underline}

Hypothetical willingness to pay (wtp) questions. Within-subject
manipulations only; standard student subject pools, small samples.

<div class="marginnote">
They do reverse order of presentations for half the participants.
  They report a lack of significant order effects, but fail to discuss
  the power of such tests or examine first-presented choices in
  isolation.
</div>


S1: Questions about (hypothetical wtp for components of government
government health insurance. "[Denominator] people die from this
disease each year. Their average age is 60. How much are you willing to
pay to cover a treatment that will save the lives of [Numerator] of
these people?"... (Numerator=90 or 900; Denominator=100, 1000, or
10,000), all combinations presented to all participants.

S2: Set of causes, each gave wtp for a government program for a 5%
reduction in that cause of death and for saving 2,600 lives, also rating
prevalence and importance. He reports a very high correlation between
wtp by these two measures, an "insensitivity to quantity", and both wtp
measures are higher when subjects report a higher prevalence (even
controlling for stated importance).

[Evaluation of paper's evidence]{.underline}: This evidence appears
highly limited. There is some evidence that denominators matter when
they (arguably) should not, and participants show confusion between
proportions and absolute amounts. The second experiment is highly
cognitively demanding and participants have no strong incentive to "get
this right." The first experiment has arguable confounds: e.g., one
might question the scientific credibility of the treatment that (claims
to) save only a small number of lives out of a very large population.
The evidence does not seem to offer much strength over and above the
Fetherstonhaugh paper. I also found much of the statistical reporting to
be incomplete or unclear, especially for study two. In general, this is,
at its best, evidence of quantitative confusion which may go in either
direction in any given context.

It is also detached from the charity realm, considering the domain of
government expenditure and benefits that will accrue to the participant
him or herself. For this reason, I listed it is tangential evidence and
not charity specific evidence.

-   "support-for-intervention", 7-point scale

-   "Lives-to-save"

Treatments started with one size, then presented a "task force's new

### Potential Solutions

```{block2,  type='fold'}

1.  Framing

a.  Frame down denominator (suggestive evidence from Fetherstonhaugh, etc)

b.  Report absolute or proportional number of lives that could be
   saved by an intervention depending on which suggests a smaller
   denominator (how do you know?)

c.  Highlight numerator (impact) (evidence?)

d.  (Ari:) "Increase evaluability: putting interventions on same
   page instead of separate pages"

2.  De-biasing (discussed further in Friedrich et al - expand)

*Consider:*

-   *"The proportion dominance effect was primarily mediated by
   perceived impact." (Erlandsson et al, 2015, OBHDP)*

-   *"Perceived Utility (not Sympathy) Mediates the Proportion Dominance
   Effect in Helping Decisions" (Erlandsson et al, 2013)*

## Statistical/identifiable victim effect

Cite: Hsee13, small2003helping, kogut2011identifiable, small2007sympathy_s3_s4

## Availability heuristic 

(in probabilities?)

People judge the probability of events and the importance of problems by the ease by which they can be brought to mind.  This may  impact  the importance they ascribe to causes and charities.	Effective  causes may be distant and underreported, for various reasons. Furthermore there may be a set of charities that are for a variety of reasons underreported or unconnected to the lives of the majority of donors; these will be neglected (and thus  more effective by dint of a lack of funding).

Study finds ‘no correlation’ between overhead and effectiveness-- is it convincing? Does working abroad increase overhead? Most relevant tie: doing impact evaluation will itself increase overhead.

<!-- ## Possible: Altruistic opportunity cost neglect -->
 
 
## Possible: Misunderstanding need (and misunderstanding marginality/tractability/sunk costs?)

```{block2,  type='fold'}


Related terms: misunderstanding marginality, misunderstanding tractability, sunk cost fallacies

**Misperceiving tractability:**

1) donations may respond to number of *deaths* from a disaster rather than to the scale of the need of *survivors* (sunk losses)

2) donations may respond to average cost per life saved, rather than marginal cost per life 

General barrier to accurate assessment of effectiveness ergo a barrier to effective giving.

## Scope insensitivity/embedding effect/part-whole effect

```{block2,  type='note'}
"People's stated valuation or "willingness to pay" for an outcome seems not to strongly increase in the magnitude of that outcome.  For example,  when asked in isolation people might say they are willing to pay $50 to save 100 eagles.  Other people asked in isolation may  say they are willing to pay $50 to save 5000 eagles.

Kahneman1992 (Part I: Embedding effect):
the expressed willingness of Toronto residents to pay increased taxes to prevent the drop in fish populations in all Ontario lakes was only slightly higher than the willingness to pay to preserve the fish stocks in only a small area of the province."
```  

```{block2,  type='note'}
When assessing effectiveness  in determining which charity to donate to (and how much),  a utilitarian  should be very sensitive to the scale of the impact (essentially the benefit per cost). If people  are scope insensitive they will be bad at making these judgments (particularly when presented in isolation).

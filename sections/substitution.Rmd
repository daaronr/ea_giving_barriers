# Are charities in competition? Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? {#substitution}

Are charitable gifts complements or substitutes; are charities rivals? Does one donation request (or donation itself) crowd out another, and if so when and by how much?  This is critical to understanding  the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch' from less to more effective charities. To the extent this crowding-out occurs, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressuring you to give to local organisations) themselves represent barriers to EA giving.

## Theoretical framework and concerns

What does this question even mean? In a standard Economics framework  we would consider joint optimization over "gifts to an ineffective charity" and "gifts to an effective charity"; one doesn’t "respond" to the other.

<div class="marginnote">
(or an optimization over ’gifts to the causes these represent’)
</div>


Prices/ external changes shift each, but we can’t "force you to voluntarily give." Furthermore, "prices" are unclear in this context (see Economics models of giving) and prices for one cause or charity rarely vary exogenously.

\

If we *could* shift the 'meaningful giving' \(\rightarrow\) we could use theory of Conditional Demand [@Pollak1969] \(\rightarrow\) "expenditure substitution" [@reinsteinDoesOneCharitable]. Still, the sign of the conditional demand effects are straightforward only under very restrictive conditions. 

\

What we *can* measure in a straightforward way (in principle): Does a promotion for a less-effective charity (such as CRUK) cause more or less giving to a more-effective charity (such as Oxfam)? Most of the work discussed below focuses on this sort of estimate.


\


A more difficult question: Is the causality:

- CRUK promo \(\rightarrow\) give more to CRUK \(\rightarrow\) give less (more) to Oxfam?

- But can we rule out *direct* effects of the first promotion? (see [@Heckman2015a] on "mediators")


This is in fact relevant for a policymaker. She might face a ’shock’ that she knows or expects will lead to donations to charity A to rise by EUR 1,000,000 EUR. She will want to know 'how much can we expect donations to charity B to fall?'

\

*What underlying causes might lead the effect to go in one direction or the other?*  
 
The psychological ideas of "self-image management" and "moral-licensing"
could also be expressed in terms of a utility function with particularly
diminishing returns to total charitable giving; there may be a discount
rate on the recency of the donation, as in a *perishable* good.

### Expenditure substitution maths {-#expend-subst}

<div class="marginnote">
This is largely drawn from the appendix of [@reinsteinSubstitutionMotivationsCharitable2011]
</div>
 

Assuming that utility is separable in own consumption and charitable
gifts, and assuming an additive specific shock (\(\alpha\)), we can
express utility as: \[U=f(x)+V(g_{1},g_{2}-\alpha )\] *where* the
functions \(V\) and \(f\) are functions that represent utility from
own-consumption and from charitable giving, repectively.

The budget constraint can be written as:

\[x+p_{1}g_{1}+p_{2}g_{2}\leq Y\] *where* \(Y\) represents total wealth,
\(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) are the prices of giving to charities one and
two (per dollar the charity receives), and I normalize the price of own
consumption to one.

Under this model, the marginal “indirect effect” of a shock
(\(\frac{\partial g_{1}}{\partial \alpha })\) can be expressed simply as
a function of the marginal “direct effect” of the shock
(\(\frac{\partial g_{2}}{\partial \alpha }\)). Standard comparative
statics of the optimal choices (assuming an interior solution and other
standard regularity conditions) yields the total derivatives:
\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{d\alpha } &=&\frac{\lambda _{\alpha }}{U_{xx}} \\
\frac{dg_{1}}{d\alpha } &=&\frac{\lambda _{\alpha }(p_{2}U_{12}-p_{1}U_{22})%
}{U_{12}^{2}-U_{11}U_{22}} \\
\frac{dg_{2}}{d\alpha } &=&1+\frac{\lambda _{\alpha
}(p_{2}U_{11}-p_{1}U_{12})}{-U_{12}^{2}+U_{11}U_{22}}\end{aligned}\]
*where* \(\lambda (\alpha ,p_{1},p_{2})\) is the shadow value of the
budget constraint, \(U_{IJ}\)
\(\equiv \frac{\partial ^{2}U}{\partial I\partial
J}\),
\(\lambda _{\alpha }\equiv \frac{\partial \lambda (\alpha ,p_{1},p_{2})}{%
\partial \alpha }\).

Hence

\[\frac{dg_{1}}{d\alpha }=(\frac{dg_{2}}{d\alpha }-1)\frac{%
p_{2}U_{12}-p_{1}U_{22}}{p_{1}U_{12}-p_{2}U_{11}}\]

The sign of the marginal effect on \(g_{1}\) (relative to the marginal
effect on \(g_{1}\)) can be either positive or negative, and will depend
on the partial second derivatives of utility and the relative prices.

Looking at the discrete effect:
\[g_{1}(\alpha _{1})-g_{1}(\alpha _{0})=\int_{\alpha _{0}}^{\alpha _{1}}[(%
\frac{dg_{2}}{d\alpha }(g_{1,}g_{2})-1)\frac{%
p_{2}U_{12}(g_{1,}g_{2})-p_{1}U_{22}(g_{1,}g_{2})}{%
p_{1}U_{12}(g_{1,}g_{2})-p_{2}U_{11}(g_{1,}g_{2})}]d\alpha
\label{integralgeneral}\]

With quadratic utility (defined in fold), the partial derivatives will be constants,

```{block2,  type='fold'}

$U(x_{0},x_{1},...,x_{n})=x_{0}+\Sigma
_{i=1}^{n}\alpha _{i}x_{i}-(\Sigma _{i=1}^{n}\beta _{i}x_{i}^{2}+2\Sigma
_{i\neq j}^{n}\gamma _{ij}x_{i}x_{j})/2$
```


and the *discrete* indirect effect, as well as the marginal effect, will
be a simple linear function of the direct effect:


$$g_{1}(\alpha )=A+Bg_{2}(\alpha )$$

*where* $A$ and $B$ are constants.

Quadratic utility is often justified as a second-order approximation to any other utility function. With other utility functions the partial derivatives may vary at different consumption bundles, so the indirect
effect may be a nonlinear function of the direct effect, but these should be solvable  for a predictable functional form, which for estimation purposes, can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a polynomial function. 






## Previous approaches and evidence


<div class="marginnote">
 
The material in this section largely overlaps the literature review in Reinstein, Reiner and Vance-McMullen 202 ongoing, in the repository https://github.com/gerhardriener/CharitySubstitutionExperiment/, in the file lit-synth.Rmd

These should be integrated with one another.
</div>


There is a **lack of data** on donations at the individual-charity level.

For identification: Lack of **independent observable variation** in price, shocks, or appeals.

**Intertemporal substitution** is an issue, and we typically **cannot observe 'lifetime giving.' **

Estimation of 'Expenditure substitution' [@reinsteinDoesOneCharitable] is complicated by issues of extensive vs intensive margins, as well as  heterogeneity.


### Observational work


**Observational data** typically lacks shocks that are clearly
*specific* to giving to one charity. Observational data on charitable
giving (e.g., survey data or tax data) offers few variables that can be
used to identify 'specific' shocks – shocks that alter giving to one
charity but have no independent effect on giving to other charities.
Most observable variables that are believed to increase giving to one
charity will also increase giving to other charities, masking
substitution effects.


#### Signing-the-bias approach {-}

**However, under reasonable assumptions we can *sign* this bias, and
thus estimate a lower bound on substitution.**

@reinsteinDoesOneCharitable using PSID/COPPS data
finds some evidence of expenditure substitution, especially for large givers.


He makes a “bounding below” argument

- Issues: charity categorization/misreporting; bounded result only

- He finds many negative significant correlations between residuals from
fixed-effects regressions on donations to categories of charitable causes

- This especially holds for larger (prior) donors and for certain paired cause categories

- Under what he argues to be plausible econometric assumptions (essentially, a net positive correlations between the residuals of 'propensity to donate to each cause')  $\rightarrow$ negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution

- Interpretation: heterogeneous motivations for giving, small vs large givers

#### Observational data paired with 'exogenous' shocks {-}

[@Deryugina2015]

Donations in a state affected by tornado increase 1.7-2 percent in that year and 1.9-2 percent in the 2 years after. The authors can only reject 'full crowding out'.

\

[@scharfLiftShiftEffect2017]

These authors observe "CAF accounts"; for this particular group, they observe all donations over a substantial period.

- $\rightarrow$ Reject 'full crowd-out', tight zero LR crowdout

$\rightarrow$ non-disaster giving pre-poned (!), esp. for disaster/intl donors; "halo effect?"
Estimates: +.537 log donations to DEC-13, se .032; -0.008 log donations to 'other charities', se 0.017 $\rightarrow$  Reject 'full crowd-out', tight zero LR crowdout

*Interpretation...*

consistent with...  for (only) people responding to the DEC appeal ... the disaster appeal increased the effectiveness with which donating to all charities, including Other charities, produces warm glow utility—a halo effect

They argue that their data allows them to reject the transactions cost explanation because they see i.  less bunching than usual, ii. shifts in amounts given and not just at the extensive margin and
iii.  a particular shift from certain categories.

Issues:  Specific CAF population; disaster-specific; time-series variation issues (6 disasters=lumpy?)

### Simultaneous/proximate ‘lab’ experiments

(esp. Reinstein 2006/11; [@Filiz-Ozbay2019])


*Figures: Berkeley design, types*

Vary choice sets/prices, shocks $\rightarrow$ crowd-out, esp.  similar causes


*Figures: Berkeley line graphs*

(Reinstein, 2011)  $\rightarrow$ Strong "expenditure substitution" responses to shocks, esp for similar charities; approx 50\% crowd-out; 2.59 cross-price-elast)

- Heterogeneity; mix of 'fixed purse', 'flexible purse/never substitute']

@Filiz-Ozbay2019 : Five paired choices, varying 'rebate rate' for one only; price-focus
   - 'Stealing' almost always
   - +0.35 net cross-price elast for 'substitute' charities

-  @Harwell; @Schmitz: somewhat related designs, similar results in favor

### Lab/framed experiments with time gaps

- Vance-Mullen component of Reinstein et al


\

### Field/natural experiments

Notes from previous paper (unfold)

```{block2,  type='fold'}

\cite{van2009does} offer some field experimental evidence on the crowding-out effects of direct mail solicitations. %[RESULTS?]
\cite{borgloh-have} investigated the impact of the German church tax on households' other charitable giving. \cite{null2011warm} used a field experiment to examine how donations to different charities respond to changes in relative match rates -- however, as the total donation was decided ex-ante, the substitution among charities was constrained to be complete. Finally, an earlier work (\citealp{andreoni1996cct}) examines substitution between giving and volunteering. However, to the best of my knowledge, no work directly addresses the cross-price elasticity (nor the expenditure substitution) between gifts to charitable causes.
```

- @Meer2014, @meerDoesFundraisingCreate2017: [DonorsChoose.org](donorschoose.org) competition, matching campaigns

2017: Increased funding for project, no significant impact on donations to other projects

@Meer2014: "increased competition reduces the likelihood of a project being funded"


- @Donkers2017: Extra mailings to existing donors in a week, top-NL charities
  - Extra mailings +1.81 EUR for charity,
  - -0.10 EUR per 'regular' mailing for *other* charity in *same week*
  - loss of 10\% of revenues via competitive effects
  - can't reject zero-crowding, but wide CI's

- Anticipated second asks:  [@adenaGivingOnceGiving2019; @Cairns2011]

@Cairns2011: *Anticipated* `2nd collection' at Mass raised 7695 USD , reduced 1st collections by 1708 USD  (22\% "crowdout")

@adenaGivingOnceGiving2019: Anticipated repetition $\rightarrow$ 40\% less "this year" (but also a *persistent* lower don)


Reinstein et al, 2020: First field-experiment to ask (or not ask) on multiple separate occasions with a significant delay, vary this delay time; find some crowding out but evidence on interaction with delay time is mixed. Possibly two channels: consistency versus fading of moral license/warm glow.


## Synthesis (emerging)

```{r, out.width='85%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Papers on substitution; database'}

knitr::include_graphics('picsfigs/subst_meta_cut.png')

```

Proximate asks and clearly presented comparisons $\rightarrow$ expected crowding-out

A particular issue: apparent contrast, **Coherent arbitrariness**, narrow brackets, framing (how people think they ‘should behave’ or how they behave when they are in a deliberative self-reflecting mode. This may characterize some giving decisions but it is probably not the most common.

With naturally-occurring, more time-separated shocks and asks, the results are more mixed, sometimes with much smaller, or no apparent substitution.

So how proximate is proximate? Evidence is still mixed (see above discussion on dual channels)

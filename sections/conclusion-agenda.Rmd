# Conclusion; a research agenda {#conclusion-agenda} 

Need for systematic platforms to study this, systematic experimentation and data sharing among effective/international charities. Platforms available, proposals for particular research projects and approaches.
 

- Who gives to the *truly* most effective international charities?

- Who is most likely to be convinced, and which arguments/presentations work in the SR and LR, and for whom (heterogeneity)?
     Statistical learning-based analyses

- Practicable techniques in a range of higher-stakes real-world environments

- Replication (and verification), pooled evidence, meta-analysis
  - Context-sensitivity, large SE $\rightarrow$ large samples, statistical learning controls, sharing data
  - Responses to 'obvious contrasts' seem to not reflect between-subject responses"

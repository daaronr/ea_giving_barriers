### Non-technical abstract {-#pop-abstract} 

Hunger, homelessness, mental and physical illness, environmental degradation: the needs are boundless, but the resources to solve these problems are limited. Even with the best of intentions and impressive generosity (Americans give roughly 2% of their income to charity!), donors often contribute to inefficient charities -- ones that spend more but accomplish less than others that may be competing for the same funds. Each dollar given to the most effective charities (like those rated by [Givewell.org](http://givewell.org)) benefits greater numbers of people in more significant ways than the least effective ones. However, donors do not always consider "Effective Altruism" (EA) when deciding how much to give and to which organizations.

Academics (in Economics, Psychology, Biology, and Philosophy) have applied a range of theories to explain what drives "inefficient altruism." Evidence comes from a variety of studies, involving surveys, observational work, laboratory experiments, and, where feasible, natural field experiments. These have not been run as part of a systematic project addressing this issue; goals, contexts, and approaches have varied as opportunities presented. Given the disparate findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors impact effective giving.

## Overview

**[Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving](#present-puzzle)** 

<div class="marginnote">
Why should you care about this? Descriptives of giving (US, international) and how 'ineffective' it is. Potential global welfare gains to changing 'where we give'. Lack of previous evidence/synthesis
</div>

\


- [Motivation and descriptives](#motivate-puzzle)
- [Definitions - "Efficiency" versus impact](#impact-definitions)

<div class="marginnote">
Relevant to charity 'quality ratings', overhead aversion
</div>

\

- Why (under what models) is this a puzzle?](#why-puzzle)
  -  Economics and psych models $\rightarrow$  puzzle?
  - Models where people care about the impact of their gift or just 'amount sacrificed' (naive warm glow). 
  - Does impact map into the 'good feeling' from giving, can it do so?

\

- [Conceptual breakdown of 'barriers' (first presentation)](#barriers-concept)


\

<div class="marginnote">
Do people *actually care about* impact? Does moral utilitarianism matter?
</div>

<!-- Economic and psych models conceptualizing this -->

\

**  [Are charities in competition? Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? Ask people to give to EA charity 'instead'?](#substitution)**

<!-- (Or put in section 2?) -->

Are charitable gifts complements or substitutes; are charities are
rivals? Does one donation request ask (or donation itself) crowd out another, and if so when and how much?   This is critical to understanding  the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch'  from less to more effective charities. To the extent this crowding-out is the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors' pressuring you to give to local organisations) themselves represent barriers to EA giving.

\

** [Explaining the puzzle: Barriers to EA giving and potential responses, evidence](#barriers-intro) ** 

<!-- moved old classification to barriers_old_classification.Rmd -->

Here we also give a general ['conceptual' overview of these barriers](#barriers-concept). We dig into each barrier more carefully in subsequent chapters.

\

** [Barriers: Awareness, consideration, and distance](#aware-distance) **

<div class="marginnote">
Whether a cause/charity is something people are aware of, feel is important/salient, and feel close to.
</div>

<div class="marginnote">
Responses?:  (Info enhancing) social closeness of recipient 
</div>

** [Barriers: Identity and cognitive dissonance](#identity) {-}

<!-- Volunteer experience unlocks emotion and giving -->

** [Barriers: Signaling and social pressures/social identity](#social) **

<!-- Self-interest/local public good [put elsewhere or remove??
Social perceptions and signaling empathy vs effectiveness; related: difficulty of coordinated signaling with a hard-to-coordinate measure such as 'effectiveness'
-->

** [Barriers: Aversion/obstacles to *doing* (using) evaluations; effect of analytical information on generosity](#eval-aversion) **
 
** [Barriers: Quantitative biases](#quant-biases) **

** [Barriers: Inertia and systemic/institutional](#inertia) **

** [Tools for motivating EA giving](#tools) **

** [Conclusion; a research agenda](#conclusion-agenda) **


## Structure of each 'barriers' section {-#structure-barriers} 

**In each section we consider:**

**A category of barriers (first-level heading, e.g. '[Quantitative biases](#quant-biases)) **

Here we discuss this category in general, explaining its meaning and plausibility in terms of the underlying theories, models, and generalized observations.


\
**Each specific barrier in this category** gets a second-level heading, e.g., ["Proportional dominance effect"](#prop-dom)

\

For each specific barrier we first present (third-level headings)

- **Definition** of the barrier
- **Conceptual explanation of the barrier**, relating this to theory and generalized observation
- **Relevance to the effective giving** (sometimes recapping what was stated above)

\
Next we consider the **Evidence**, with a third-level header preamble discussing the nature of the evidence

Within this, we consider the **evidence for each specific empirical claim** supporting the case for this barrier's existence and importance.

\

In considering the evidence for these claims, we generally consider one paper or project at a time (or a specific piece of independent evidence from this paper). However, we are still thinking about the best narrative approach to presenting evidence from multiple papers/projects/analyses.  For each paper we focus on key elements such as:

- Method (lab experiment involving real charitable asks, natural field experiment with charity partner, observational analysis asserting causality via a regression discontinuity approach, etc.)

- The context and data (the population of donors or lab participants, the charity(s) involved, etc.)

- The nature of the 'treatment' or independent variable (e.g., realistic information presented about impact per dollar)

- The strength and credibility of the empirical results (considering, e.g., limitations and confounds in the design, experimenter-demand effects, estimates' statistical strength and power, appropriateness of the statistical analysis, preregistration, signs of specification-fishing and multiple-testing without corrections, replications and citations, etc.)

We (should) also link where to find the paper itself as well as the materials and hte data collected.

```{block2,  type='note'}
For example, within the category **[Barriers: Aversion/obstacles to *doing* (using) evaluations; effect of analytical information on generosity](#eval-aversion)** ...
  
we consider the barrier ["General cost-benefit analysis (CBA)-aversion or reluctance"](#cba-aversion)...
  
weighing evidence  specific claims such as ["People sometimes actively avoid information about charity effectiveness that would motivate doing a CBA..."](-#avoid_info_CBA)...
                                                                                coming from research papers/studies such as **[@Fong2011]**.

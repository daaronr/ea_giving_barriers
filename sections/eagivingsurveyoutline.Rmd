# INTRODUCTION & FUNDAMENTALS {-}


```{block2,  type='note'}
In this set of chapters:

- What is this project about and how is it organised, outline of chapters
- What is the main question or 'puzzle' and how do we know it 'real' and important?
- Fundamental question: are charities in competitino
- How do we *consider* 'barriers' and analyse the evidence (and organize this?)

```

# Introduction and outline {#outline}

<center>

**Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next**

</center>

<!-- #TODO: reconcile this with the outline in 'EA giving survey-working version'... -->

\


*This outline links, and gives a brief description of each section*

<!-- David Reinstein (drafted this version) with Nick Fitz and Ari Kagan -->

## Overview

**Section** \@ref(present-puzzle)**: [Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving](#present-puzzle)** \*

::: {.marginnote}
\* Why should you care about this? Descriptives of giving (US, international) and how 'ineffective' it is. Potential global welfare gains to changing 'where we give'. Lack of previous evidence/synthesis
:::

<!-- -->

-   [Motivation and descriptives](#motivate-puzzle)

-   [Definitions - "Efficiency" versus impact](#impact-definitions)\*\*

    ::: {.marginnote}
    \*\* Relevant to charity 'quality ratings', overhead aversion
    :::

-   [Why (under which models) is this a puzzle?](#why-puzzle)\*\*\*

-   [Conceptual breakdown of 'barriers' (first presentation)](#barriers-concept)

<div class="marginnote">
\*\*\* Briefly mapping outlining this...

-   Do people *actually care about* impact? Does moral utilitarianism matter?

-   Economics and psych models $\rightarrow$ puzzle?

-   Models where people care about the impact of their gift or just 'amount sacrificed' (naive warm glow).

-   Does impact map into the 'good feeling' from giving, can it do so?

</div>

<!-- Economic and psych models conceptualizing this -->

\

**Section** \@ref(substitution)**: Are charities in competition? Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? Should we ask people to give to EA charity 'instead' of the charities they currently give to?**

<!-- (Or put in section 2?) -->

Are charitable gifts complements or substitutes; are charities rivals? Does one donation request ask (or donation itself) crowd out another, and if so when and how much? This is critical to understanding the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch' from less to more effective charities.

To the extent this crowding-out *is* present, *all* factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors' pressuring you to give to local organisations) *themselves* represent barriers to EA giving.

\

**Section** \@ref(barriers-concept)**: [Explaining the puzzle: Barriers to EA giving and potential responses, evidence](#barriers-concept)**

<!-- moved old classification to barriers_old_classification.Rmd -->

Here we also give a general ['conceptual' overview of these barriers](#barriers-concept). We dig into each barrier more carefully in subsequent chapters.

\

**BARRIERS: DEFINITION & EVIDENCE** chapters; these are outlined under [' Practical breakdown'](#barriers-practical)


**Section** \@ref(tools)**: [Tools for motivating EA giving](#tools)**

**Section** \@ref(conclusion-agenda)**: [Conclusion; a research agenda](#conclusion-agenda)**

## Structure of each 'barriers' section {#structure-barriers}

**In each 'barriers' section we consider...** 

1. **A category of barriers**; this is a first-level heading, e.g. '[Quantitative biases](#quant-biases)' is section \@ref(quant-biases).

Here we discuss this category in general, explaining its meaning and plausibility in terms of the underlying theories, models, and generalized observations.

2. **Each specific barrier in this category** gets a second-level heading, e.g., ["Proportional dominance effect"](#prop-dom) is section \@ref(prop-dom).


3. For each specific barrier we first present (third-level headings):

-   **Definition** of the barrier
-   **Conceptual explanation of the barrier**, relating this to theory and generalized observation
-   **Relevance to effective giving** (sometimes recapping what was stated above)

\
4. Next we consider the **Evidence**, with a third-level header preamble discussing the nature of the evidence.

5. Within this, we consider the **evidence for each specific empirical claim** supporting the case for this barrier's existence and importance.


```{block2,  type='note'}

We hope to:

- 'operationalize' each claim with a falsifiable set of predictions
   - justifying the connection to each prediction,

- and carefully asses the strength of the evidence for each of these claims. 

See, e.g., our work-in-progress on 'CBA avoidance' [here](#cba-evidence).

This distinguishes the current project from broader reviews and literature surveys.

```  

\

In considering the evidence for these claims, we generally consider one paper or project at a time (or a specific piece of independent evidence from this paper).\*

::: {.marginnote}
\* However, we are still considering the best narrative approach to presenting evidence from multiple papers/projects/analyses.
:::

### Consideration of each paper {#paper-structure}

For each paper we focus on key elements, including:

-   **Method** (lab experiment involving real charitable asks, natural field experiment with charity partner, observational analysis asserting causality via a regression discontinuity approach, etc.)

-   The **context** and data (the population of donors or lab participants, the charity(s) involved, etc.)

-   The **nature of the 'treatment'** or independent variable (e.g., realistic information presented about impact per dollar)

-   The **strength and credibility of the empirical results** (considering, e.g., limitations and confounds in the design, experimenter-demand effects, estimates' statistical strength and power, appropriateness of the statistical analysis, preregistration, signs of specification-fishing and multiple-testing without corrections, replications and citations, etc.)

- Link where to find the paper itself as well as the materials and the data collected.\

```{block2,  type='note'}
For example, within the category **[Barriers: Aversion/obstacles to *doing* (using) evaluations; effect of analytical information on generosity](#eval-aversion)** ...

we consider the barrier ["General cost-benefit analysis (CBA)-aversion or reluctance"](#cba-aversion)...

weighing evidence  specific claims such as ["People sometimes actively avoid information about charity effectiveness that would motivate doing a CBA..."](-#avoid_info_CBA)...


coming from research papers/studies such as  @fongTruthGivingExperimental2010.

```


## Evidence and meta-analysis: discussion {#evidence0meta}


We consider\*

<div class="marginnote">
\*Further discussion needed here
</div>


1. The nature of evidence for drivers of effective/ineffective giving, and how we might evaluate it

2. Meta analysis: Existing work and plans for doing meta-analysis as part of this project

See [innovationsinfundraising](https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=tools:meta-analysis_approach#references_and_discussion_of_specific_issues_in_meta-analysis) for some earlier discussion of this, as well as ["What works to increase charitable donations? A meta-review with meta-meta-analysis" by Noetel et al](https://psyarxiv.com/yxmva/)



## Airtable organisation; contributing content {#airtable-contrib}

**These classifications of barriers** are organised, outlined, and defined in our Airtable; see the view below.

**The barriers themselves** are organised as well, see the view below:

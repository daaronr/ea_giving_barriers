2b. Barriers: Presenting analytical/impact information switches off system 1;

> done per dollar spent) will have a positive effect on amounts raised,
> and donation propensity. The evidence (from the Economics/Behavioral
> Economics literature) is largely mixed and indeterminate. There has
> been only a single strong field trial (Karlan) in a particular
> context, which itself reported mixed (null overall, positive for some
> subgroups, negative for others), and some underpowered results.
> Laboratory experiments (with real donations) by Small et al find that
> giving to an identifiable victim is reduced when statistics \[about
> what? Not 'effectiveness'\] are also presented and "priming analytic
> thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a
> feeling-based thinking prime." \[Supported Erlandsson ea '16 for the
> identified victim but not for a group\]. Further evidence from lab
> experiments is mixed and limited, with some studies (Fong and O)
> apparently finding that exogenous information about recipients
> \[?deservingness\] increases donations (although they do not report
> this), and another underpowered study (Metzger and G). There is some
> evidence from observational studies that "charity ratings" boost
> giving, at least for smaller charities (Yoruk), but these ratings do
> not measure impact \[and it is not the presence/absence of such
> information but its valence; also consider the 2-dimensions of
> rating\]. Further review should explore the psychology (see., e.g.,
> Verkaik), marketing, and nonprofit management literatures. There is
> some speculation, but again, mixed evidence, that individuals already
> in a "system 2" (deliberative) frame are more likely to be positively
> affected by impact information.

> There is also a distinction to be further explored between "output

Hidden Motives Behind Ineffective Altruism

Current Draft: April 21, 2018

Abstract

We donate billions of dollars to charities each year^1^, yet much of our
giving is ineffective^2-4^. Why are we motivated to give, but not
motivated to give effectively^6-8^? Standard evolutionary game theory
can explain why we contribute to public goods, but not why ignore
efficacy^10,\ 12,\ 37^. Behavioral research makes a strong case that
proximate motivations for giving---such as warm glow and empathy---are
insensitive to effectiveness, but does not explain what is driving this
insensitivity^13-17^. We explain why by pointing out that people do not
have an incentive to attend to effectiveness. Building on recent
theoretical advances demonstrating the role of common knowledge and
categorical distinctions, we argue that donors are insensitive to
efficacy because: (i) effectiveness is difficult to observe, (ii) even
those who do observe effectiveness do not know if others do, and (iii)
even if effectiveness were observed it could not be used to coordinate
norm enforcement^21,\ 38^. We present five pieces of novel experimental
evidence: (i) donors are insensitive to donation matches but sensitive
to savings matches; (ii) donors are sensitive to the number of people
suffering when making choices on behalf of family members, but not
strangers; (iii) third party rewarders are insensitive to how much
donations are matched; (iv) third party rewarders are insensitive to how
much the donor gave; and, (v) third party rewarders are insensitive to
what fraction the donor gave. We end by discussing implications for the
evolution of cooperation, norm enforcement, moral realism, behavioral
models, and practical ramifications for the effective altruism movement.

Reputations Can Explain Ineffective Altruism

When we spend money on ourselves---on a weekend trip, a new coat, a
dinner out---we typically attend to the value we are getting for our
money. We weigh alternatives, read reviews, and ask our friends for
advice. Yet when we instead donate our money or time to charities, value
has a surprisingly minor impact on our decisions. Although Americans
donate 2% of GDP to charity^1^ and volunteer for over 7 billion hours a
year^55^, we devote relatively little time and money to determining
which charities are effective before we donate^13,\ 14^. As a result,
there is little correlation between a charity's value and its
popularity^2-5^, though charities vary widely in how effectively they
use the money donated to them. Even direct manipulations of value often
matter little to us: we will pay the same to save 2,000 as 200,000 birds
from an oil spill, and do not donate more when matching grants will
multiply the impact of our dollar^39-40^. Likewise, the emotions that
motivate us to give are insensitive to impact and potential impact;
positive feelings tend to arise from the act of giving, not the
outcome^13,\ 17^, and we often feel more empathy for one stranger in
need than for many^15,\ 16^.

This is puzzling because it seems to contradict our experience. We feel
as if we care about the impact we are having with our altruistic giving.
We feel that we give because we believe that it is important to help
others, because we want to make a difference to those suffering from
poverty, disease, inequality and so on. And yet, we don't act as if we
want to make a difference. We often do not even feel better when we make
a bigger difference. Why this discrepancy?

Behavioral research shows that proximate motivations for giving---such
as warm glow and empathy---are insensitive to effectiveness, but does
not explain why this is the case. We suggest that our proximate motives
are insensitive to effectiveness because we do not have an incentive to
attend to effectiveness.

Evolutionary game theory models have widely demonstrated that norms such
as giving to charity can be sustained through a recursive logic.
^10,\ 21,\ 31,\ 37^ People follow the norm because others reward them
for it, those others reward them because they are rewarded for
rewarding, and so on. (Alternatively, people can be punished for not
following the norm or for not punishing when they should.)

There is considerable evidence in favor of these evolutionary game
theory accounts. We give substantially more when our contributions are
made observable^22-26^, and when giving is the norm.^27^ We are rewarded
when we give^45,\ 48^, penalized when we do not
give^43-45,\ 48-49,\ 56^, preferred for helping those who give^46-47^,
and penalized for not penalizing those who do not give^46-47^. Further,
there is evidence that these behaviors are deeply ingrained: even young
children have been shown to exhibit some of these behaviors^44-46^, and
we exhibit them even when it is clear we are not consciously
deliberating^41,\ 43,\ 56^.

If these evolutionary game theory accounts explain charitable giving,
giving should be relatively insensitive to effectiveness. This is for
two key reasons. First, norms cannot be enforced when compliance is
difficult to ascertain. Conditioning reward and punishment on the
effectiveness of a gift requires observers to know two things instead of
one: that I gave, and also that the gift was effective. Even if an
individual observer obtains this knowledge, he knows that other
observers are unlikely to have put in the effort to do so. Thus, he can
still anticipate being rewarded for rewarding me.

Second, norms cannot be enforced when they depend on thresholds in a
continuous underlying variable. The effectiveness of charitable giving,
unlike the decision to give, is such a variable. Sufficiently close to
the threshold, an observer cannot be confident that other observers
believe what he believes. This creates an incentive for the giver to
deviate from the norm and thereby weakens the threshold.

We provide novel experimental evidence supporting that these features of
norm enforcement explain ineffective giving. In studies 1 and 2 we test
the prediction that insensitivity to effectiveness is vastly reduced in
domains where the motivation to give has less to do with norm
enforcement, specifically when giving to one\'s future self (i.e.,
saving; study 1) and when giving to one\'s family members (study 2),
which is primarily motivated by a distinct evolutionary mechanism that
does not rely on higher order beliefs^12,\ 33,\ 34^. In studies 3-5 we
test two other key predictions: that third-party rewards are insensitive
to effectiveness (study 4), and that third-party rewards are likewise
insensitive to the size of the gift (studies 4 and 5).

Our first study found that people respond to effectiveness when saving
but not when donating to charity. As discussed earlier, one reason that
we might give ineffectively is that we are incapable of responding to
certain kinds of information. For example, perhaps because of the way
that our minds process numbers we cannot respond to certain differences
in magnitude unless the comparison is very salient, and this often leads
us to give ineffectively, ignoring factors such as whether there is a
matching grant magnifying our impact^39-40^. Our first study ruled this
out. In study 1a we manipulated the multiplier by which we matched
subjects' contributions when they gave to a charity of their choice,
with multipliers ranging from one to ten (see Figure 1). Giving was
almost completely insensitive to the multiplier. However, when the
contributions were matched but then returned to subjects at a later date
instead of being donated to a charity, as in a standard savings decision
with varying interest rates, subjects were highly sensitive to the
multiplier. A replication replaced the charity with a specific family in
need. (See SI for experimental stimuli and details of analyses for these
and all subsequent experiments.)

Our second study found that people respond to effectiveness when helping
family members but not when helping strangers. A common way that our
giving is ineffective is that we give the same amount regardless of how
many people (or animals) we could help, as when we are willing to pay
the same to save 200,000 or 2,000 birds^6^. One possible explanation for
this is that the psychological mechanisms that motivate us to give, such
as empathy and moral concern, are incapable of being sensitive to how
many recipients we are helping^15,16^. Our second study ruled this out.
We predicted that the motivation to help family members would be more
sensitive to the number of people we could help than the motivation to
help strangers. This is because our motivation to help family members is
largely explained by the genes we share with them^33,34^. Unlike
psychology based on norm enforcement, the disposition to help those who
share our genes should be sensitive to effectiveness, because helping
those genes succeed is what makes them more likely to continue on in the
gene pool. In study 2 we asked subjects to imagine that one or five
people were going to go hungry for a year, and varied whether these
people were unknown children in their country or members of their family
(see Figure 2). Each subject only saw one of these four versions. Using
a variant of a common technique in the literature^6^, we then asked
subjects to indicate what percentage of their income they would give up
to prevent this from happening, assuming that no one else could prevent
it. Subjects were willing to pay more to save more family members from
hunger, but were not similarly willing to pay more to save more
strangers, even though they were willing to contribute substantially to
helping these strangers (see Figure 2).

Our third study found that when others reward us for giving they respond
to whether we give but not to how efficiently we give. In this study, we
paired subjects with a donor who chose whether to donate all or none of
their bonus to a charity, and who was told that their donation would be
matched with a multiplier ranging from one to ten. Subjects were given
the option to pay any percentage of their bonus to reward this donor. As
an incentive to give, the donor received triple what subjects paid.
Subjects rewarded donors more if they chose to donate, but rewards were
not sensitive to the multiplier (see Figure 3). It might seem reasonable
that we wouldn't reward donations more because they happen to have a
greater impact for reasons outside of the donor's control, but we might
at least have expected that keeping money would be punished more when
the gift could have done more good. Yet, the reduction in reward
incurred for keeping the bonus was not sensitive to the multiplier. This
was not because subjects didn't care about the effect of the multiplier:
a separate sample of subject from the same pool reported being willing
to wait 16.24 days for a gain in their bonus equivalent to the effect of
the smallest multiplier (doubling). We also collected judgments of the
donor's character as another measure of reward, as often rewards or
punishments come in the form of other people's impressions that become
gossip, influencing who wants to cooperate with us^49^. Character
judgments showed the same pattern as monetary rewards (see SI for
details).

In our next two studies we manipulated the amount of money and the
fraction of an allotment that the donor had donated (see Figure 4). Like
effectiveness, amount and fraction are continuous variables that are
more difficult to make known to observers than the act of giving. Our
theory predicts, then, that donors should be relatively insensitive to
these features of a gift. In study 4 we paired subjects with a donor who
decided whether to donate all or none of their bonus to a charity. This
bonus was either X or 2X. Thus, subjects could be paired with a donor
who kept a bonus of X, kept a bonus of 2X, donated a bonus of X, or
donated a bonus of 2X. As in study 3, subjects could pay any percentage
of a bonus to reward the donor they were paired with, and any amount
that they paid was tripled. Subjects rewarded donors more if they chose
to donate, but rewards were insensitive to effectiveness. Subjects did
not reward donors who donated 2X more than those who donated X, and did
not reward donors who kept 2X less than those who kept X. This was not
because subjects didn't care about the doubled amount: a separate sample
of subject from the same pool reported being willing to wait 2.67 days
more for a 2X bonus than for an X bonus (subjects responded either about
waiting for X or waiting for 2X). In study 5 we paired subjects with a
donor who was given the option to donate a fraction of a bonus to a
charity (among multiple options, ranging from none to all), and either
kept their entire bonus or donated a certain amount of it. We kept this
amount constant, but varied the size of the bonus, such that the donor
had donated either 67% or 80% of the total allotment. Subjects rewarded
donors more if they chose to donate, but did not reward donors more for
donating a larger fraction of their bonus, and did not penalize donors
for keeping all of a larger bonus. In both studies 4 and 5, character
judgments mirrored monetary rewards (see SI for details).

These studies provide converging evidence that reputational rewards can
explain our ineffective giving. As models of norm enforcement predict,
reputational rewards were relatively insensitive to effectiveness and
other factors that do not easily become common knowledge. Further,
subjects were capable of attending to effectiveness under conditions
where we would expect norm enforcement to play a lesser part in their
motivation, and an incentive tied closely to outcome to play a large
part.

Understanding this phenomenon is of first order importance. As has been
highlighted by a growing "Effective Altruism" movement, we could
multiply the impact of charitable giving simply by diverting funds to
more effective charities^57^. Further, scholars from multiple fields
have devoted classic papers and popular books to understanding why
altruism is so far removed from consequences^13-17,\ 54^.

Our findings have several important implications. First, they are
evidence that models of norm enforcement are the right way to think
about what motivates much of our charitable giving, and perhaps much of
our contributions to public goods in general. In theory models of norm
enforcement can explain why people contribute to public goods and why
this giving is ineffective^10,\ 21,\ 32,\ 37^; in our studies, these
models also map on well to the behavior we see in practice.

Our studies also take advantage of the fact that there are different
motives for cooperation. In addition to norm enforcement, cooperation
may be motivated by genetic relatedness---by an evolved disposition to
help one's genes in another body^12,\ 33,\ 34^. Unlike cooperation
motivated by norm enforcement, cooperation motivated by genetic
relatedness should be directly sensitive to effectiveness. Helping one's
relatives succeed makes those genes that promote familial helping more
likely to continue in the gene pool, irrespective of what others know
about the helping or whether there is a discrete definition of what
helping means. In other words, to the degree that genetic relatedness
drives helping we should see behavior consistent with Becker's classic
model of altruism^10^, in which the recipient's welfare is included in
our utility function. This key difference between helping based on norm
enforcement and that based on genetic relatedness offers a valuable tool
for testing norm enforcement models---comparing giving to strangers with
giving to family members.

Unfortunately, to the degree that norm enforcement motivates our public
goods contributions, these contributions will be ineffective to at least
some degree because of the constraints on incentivizing individuals to
follow the norm, including observability and a discrete definition of
what it means to do something "good" and "bad". Even if processes such
as group-level selection^50^ or the interests of those setting the norms
help to select for more socially beneficial norms over time, these
processes have to contend with the limitations imposed by individual
incentives.

At the same time, our research has the practical implication that we can
make giving more effective by working with these constraints. For
instance, norms sustaining giving should be more effective if
effectiveness is more visible, which could be helped by efforts to
create a common, widely accepted metric system and make people's impact
on this metric as easy to share as whether they gave. This might be best
combined with efforts to create discrete categories for effective versus
ineffective charities, as charity navigator attempts to do^21-32^. In
addition, it may help to call people out for the inconsistency between
their stated desire to have a positive impact and the ineffectiveness of
their giving, as the effective altruism movement often does in its
efforts to increase contributions to highly effective charities.
Explicitly pointing out this hypocrisy harms our ability to maintain the
cover story that we care about the outcome without actually impacting
the outcome very effectively.

Our studies are likely to raise several questions. One is how to explain
the instances in which people do attend to effectiveness and/or give
more than the minimum, even when we lack discrete categories for what
constitutes "good enough" effectiveness or giving a "good enough"
amount. To the degree that giving is sensitive to effectiveness and
givers are particularly generous, it may be motivated by social rewards
that can be conferred unilaterally, such as choosing to be someone's
friend or mate, as these don't share all of the constraints of
coordinating with others. Another question is how to explain anonymous
giving and giving in one-shot interactions. Anonymous gifts are often
discovered by at least some people, who may then appreciate that the
giver did not require the approval of the masses. Further, because
social rewards often operate unconsciously, shaping our cognitive and
emotional motivations to give^20,\ 21,\ 47^ , these motivations are
sticky, spilling over into contexts---like anonymous lab experiments or
online solicitations---where the standard reputational incentives no
longer apply. A third puzzle is the one we began with---why do we feel
like we care about the impact we are having, if our own behavior often
contradicts this? This may be in service of pooling with those who can
be trusted to genuinely help a cause succeed, perhaps because their fate
is tied to it (e.g., through the capacity to build a legacy that will
benefit their children). Or, it could benefit us to distinguish
ourselves from those who are consciously thinking about reputational
rewards and will stop giving the minute no one is watching. In both
cases, our presentation to others may be more convincing if we believe
it ourselves^58-59^.

It seems counterintuitive that norms promoting the public good, such as
those that support giving to charity, would be relatively insensitive to
variables important to the public good, such as the effectiveness of our
donations. Yet models of norm enforcement predict just this. Experiments
like those presented here can confirm the predictions from these models,
joining a broader effort^9,\ 12,\ 20-21,\ 49,\ 51,\ 58-60^ demonstrating
that, with the right tools, puzzling social behavior can be seen as a
signature of the hidden laws that shape social behavior as a whole.

**Study 1.** **Savings but not donations are sensitive to match rate**

**Figure 1.** Half of subjects in study 1 decided what percentage of
their bonus to keep and what percentage to donate to the charity of
their choice (selected earlier in the study). The other subjects in
study 1 decided what percentage of their bonus to receive immediately
and what percentage to save to receive in three months. Donations and
savings were assigned a multiplier ranging from none to ten. (Note that
all manipulations here and in subsequent studies were between subjects.)
Donations to charity were not affected by the multiplier (regression
Beta = 0.11, 95% CI \[-0.05, 0.27\], *t*(148) = 1.32, *p* = .188), but
savings were highly affected by the multiplier (regression Beta = 0.35,
95% CI \[0.20, 0.50\],*t*(150) = 4.56, *p* \< .001). (Dot area is
proportional to the number of data points with a given value; lines
represent the best fit line for donations or savings regressed on the
multiplier.) As expected, the effect of the multiplier is significantly
larger for savings than for charitable giving (regression Beta = -0.31,
95% CI \[-0.56, -0.06\], *t*(301) = -2.40, *p* = .009 for the
interaction of match and donating versus saving).

**Study 2. Willingness to help is sensitive to the number helped for
family members but not strangers**

![../../Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-11%20at%2012.31.37%20PM.png](media/image1.png){width="4.986933508311461in"
height="6.781753062117235in"}

**Figure 2.** Subjects in study 2 were asked to imagine that one or five
people went hungry for a year. These people were either members of their
family or unknown children in their country (strangers). Subjects then
reported their (hypothetical) willingness to pay to prevent this
suffering. Subjects were willing to pay a greater percentage of their
salary to prevent five family members from going hungry than to prevent
one from going hungry, but were not willing to pay more to prevent five
strangers from going hungry than to prevent one from going hungry
(regression Beta = 0.20, 95% CI \[0.08, 0.32\], *t*(604) = 3.36, *p* \<
.001 for the interaction of relationship and number). Error bars are +/-
s.e.m.

**Study 3. Reputational rewards are sensitive to whether a donor gives,
but not match rate**

![../../Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-11%20at%2012.33.07%20PM.png](media/image4.png){width="6.4944444444444445in"
height="6.230555555555555in"}

**Figure 3.** In study 3 subjects were given the option to pay any
percentage of their bonus to reward a donor. The donor received triple
what subjects paid. We paired subjects with a donor who chose whether to
donate all or none of their bonus to a charity, and who was told that
their donation had been assigned a multiplier from none to ten. Subjects
rewarded donors more if they chose to donate (regression Beta = 0.24,
95% CI \[0.06, 0.41\], *t*(538) = 2.67, *p* = .004 for the effect of
donating), but rewards were not higher for donating when there was a
higher multiplier, nor lower for not donating when there was a higher
multiplier (regression Beta = 0.07, 95% CI \[-0.12, 0.26\], *t*(538) =
-0.42, *p* = .868 for the interaction of donating and the multiplier).
(Dot area is proportional to the number of data points with a given
value; lines represent the best fit line for reward payments regressed
on the multiplier, separated by whether donors donated or kept their
bonus.) Judgments of the donor's character demonstrated the same pattern
of results.

**Study 4 & 5. Reputational rewards are sensitive to whether a donor
gives, but not donation amount or percent**

![../../Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-11%20at%2011.51.56%20AM.png](media/image2.png){width="6.648832020997375in"
height="2.7382983377077865in"}

**Figure 4**.  **a.** In study 4, we paired subjects with a donor who
chose whether to donate all or none of their bonus to a charity, and
whose bonus was either 10 cents or 20 cents. Subjects were given the
option to pay any percentage of their bonus to reward the donor. The
donor received triple what subjects paid. Subjects rewarded donors more
if they chose to donate (regression Beta = 0.25, 95% CI \[0.12, 0.38\],
*t*(419) = 3.70, *p* \< .001 for the effect of donating), but did not
reward donors who donated 20 cents more than those who donated 10 cents,
and did not reward donors who kept 20 cents less than those who kept 10
cents (regression Beta = 0.04, 95% CI \[-0.12, 0.20\], *t*(419) = 0.51,
*p* = .608 for the interaction of donating and bonus size). **b.** In
study 5, we paired subjects with a donor who chose to donate some or all
of a bonus to charity, and whose bonus was either 90 cents or 75 cents.
We paired subjects with donors who chose to donate either 60 cents or
none of their bonus. Subjects were given the option to pay any
percentage of their bonus to reward the donor. The donor received triple
what subjects paid. Subjects rewarded donors more if they chose to
donate (regression Beta = 0.27, 95% CI \[0.14, 0.40\], *t*(398) = 4.05,
*p* \< .001 for the effect of donating), but did not reward donors more
for donating a larger fraction of their bonus (regression Beta = 0.09,
95% CI \[-0.08, 0.25\], *t*(398) = 1.05, *p* = .294 for the interaction
of donating and bonus size). Judgments of the donor's character
demonstrated the same pattern of results. Error bars are +/- s.e.m.

Experimental Methods and Results

**Study 1: Savings are sensitive to a multiplier but charitable
donations are not**

**Study 1a. Sensitivity to a multiplier when saving versus donating to
charity**

**Experimental design overview.** This study contrasted how sensitive
subjects were to a multiplier when giving to charity and saving for the
future. Subjects were given a bonus and the option either to donate some
or all of the bonus to charity, or to save some or all of the bonus for
the future. Donations and savings were assigned a match ranging from no
match to 9:1.

**Subject recruitment method and the use of Amazon Turk.** We recruited
all subjects for all studies online through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)
\[1--4\]. AMT is an online marketplace where employers pay users for
completing short tasks (generally about 10 minutes), usually referred to
as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) -- for a relatively small payment
(generally less than a \$1). Workers who have been recruited on AMT
receive a baseline payment and can also be paid a bonus depending on
their performance in the task. This setup lends itself well to
incentivized experiments: the baseline payment acts as the 'show up' fee
and the bonus payment is based on the workers' behavior in the economic
game, if applicable.

**Subjects.** Subjects were 304 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 34.23, SD = 10.22, range from 18 to 67).[^1] Participation
was limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 60% were
male, 40% female. 77% were White/Caucasian, 5% African American, 5%
Hispanic, 10% Asian American, 1% marked "other," and 1% marked "prefer
not to say." 99% had graduated at least from high school, and 55% had
graduated at least from college. One subject did not answer all relevant
questions needed for the primary analyses.

**Procedure.** Subjects in this study began by selecting their top
choice charity from a list of six options: The American Cancer Society,
The Ocean Conservancy, World Animal Protection, Living Beyond Breast
Cancer, the Society for the Improvement of the Conditions of Stray
Animals, and The Nature Conservancy. They were then given a 30-cent
bonus. Half of subjects were randomly assigned to the Charity Condition
and were asked to divide this bonus any way they wished between
themselves and the charity that they had selected as their top choice
from the list of six. We also manipulated (between subjects) whether any
money donated to the charity would be matched, multiplying it. The match
levels ranged in integers from no match (donation is not increased) to
1:9 match (multiplying the donation by 10).

For example, a subject in the Charity Condition who selected the
American Cancer Society as their favorite charity, and was assigned a
1:3 match, saw the following text:

In addition to the 30 cents that you will be paid for participating, we
are giving you an additional 30 cents. You can choose to keep this 30
cents for yourself, or to donate some or all of it to the American
Cancer Society, the charity that you selected as your top choice. For
every one cent that you give, we will give three cents, so that **The
American Cancer Society receives quadruple what you give. **

How much of the 30 cents would you like to donate to **The American
Cancer Society**? (Total must sum to 30. Recall that for every one cent
that you give, we will give three cents, **quadrupling the amount**.) 

The other half of subjects were randomly assigned to the Savings
Condition and were instead asked to divide the 30-cent bonus any way
they wished between what they would receive with their study payment,
and what they would receive in three months (save). We manipulated
(between subjects) whether any money saved would be matched, multiplying
it. The match levels ranged in integers from no match (donation is not
increased) to 1:9 match (multiplying the donation by 10).

For example, a subject in the Savings Condition who was assigned a 1:3
match would see the following text:

In addition to the 30 cents that you will be paid for participating, we
are giving you an additional 30 cents. You can choose to either earn
some or all of this 30 cents with your study payment, or **wait to
receive some or all of it in three months**. For every one cent that you
give, we will give three cents, so that **in three months you receive
quadruple**.  

How much of the 30 cents would you like **to receive in three months**?
(Total must sum to 30. Recall that for every one cent that you give, we
will give three cents, **quadrupling it**.)

* *

Subjects concluded the study by answering some standard demographic
questions and providing open-ended feedback on the survey.

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted amount saved or donated from the
multiplier (from 1 to 10), whether participants donated or saved (coded
0 = saved, 1 = donated), and the interaction (multiplier\*donated or
saved). As predicted, there was a significant effect of the multiplier,
Beta = 0.36, 95% CI \[0.21, 0.51\], *t*(301) = 4.65, *p* \< .001.[^2] We
made no prediction about the amount donated versus saved, but report the
coeffective here for completeness: Beta = 0.02, 95% CI \[-0.21, 0.25\],
*t*(301) = 0.18, *p* = .855 (two-sided).

As Figure 1 shows, the predicted interaction was significant, such that
the multiplier predicts savings more strongly than it predicts
donations, Beta = -0.31, 95% CI \[-0.56, -0.06\], *t*(301) = -2.40, *p*
= .009.

**Study 1b. Sensitivity to a multiplier when saving versus donating to a
family in need**

**Experimental design overview.** Study 1b contrasted sensitivity to
multipliers for saving versus donating to a few identified individuals,
whose total scope of finances is more comparable to an individual
subject's finances than that of a charitable organization. Methods were
identical to those in study 1a, except that subjects had the opportunity
to donate to an individual family in need instead of a charitable
organization, and we used only no match and a 1:1 match.

**Subjects**. Subjects were 505 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 35.31, SD = 11.55, range from 18 to 75). Participation was
limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 57% were male,
42% female, the remaining 1% marked "other/prefer not to say." 77% were
White/Caucasian, 6% African American, 6% Hispanic, 10% Asian American,
1% Native American. 99% had graduated at least from high school, and 55%
had graduated at least from college. Two subjects did not answer all
relevant questions needed for the analyses.

**Procedure.** Subjects in this study began by reading a campaign from
the crowdsourcing website GoFundMe.org. The campaign was for a family
with a young child recently diagnosed with childhood leukemia. The text
of the campaign was as follows:

Our friends, Lisa and Derek Wolfe, are two of the finest people you will
ever meet. Lisa is one of those mom\'s you can\'t help but be jealous
of. She is more loving, nurturing, and giving than I could ever hope to
be. Lisa is one of those people that puts everyone before herself. She
is always taking care of others. It is our turn to take care of Lisa.\
\
Lisa and her little girl, Arlie, have this mesmorizing bond. In June
2016, Arlie was diagnosed with Pre B ALL, a form of childhood leukemia.
Lisa and Derek are living every parents worst nightmare. I know Arlie
will beat this cancer and come out stronger than ever, but the Wolfe\'s
have a long, hard road ahead. Let\'s ease their burden a bit so that
medical bills are the last thing on their mind.\
\
You kick cancers butt, Lady A! We love you!

Help spread the word!

After reading about the campaign, subjects were given a 30-cent bonus.
Half of subjects were randomly assigned to the Charity Condition and
were asked to divide this bonus any way they wished between themselves
and the charitable campaign that they had read about. We also
manipulated (between subjects) whether any money donated to the campaign
would be matched, multiplying it. The match levels were no match or 1:1
match.

A subject in the Charity Condition who was assigned no match saw the
following text:

In addition to the 30 cents that you will be paid for participating, we
are giving you an additional 30 cents. You can choose to keep this 30
cents for yourself, or to **donate some or all of it to the campaign you
just read about**.

How much of the 30 cents would you like to **donate to the campaign**?
(Total must sum to 30.) 

A subject in the Charity Condition who was assigned a 1:1 match saw the
following text:

In addition to the 30 cents that you will be paid for participating, we
are giving you an additional 30 cents. You can choose to keep this 30
cents for yourself, or to **donate some or all of it to the campaign you
just read about**. For every one cent that you give, we will also give
one cent, so that **this campaign receives double what you give**. 

How much of the 30 cents would you like to **donate to the campaign**?
(Total must sum to 30. Recall that for every one cent that you give, we
will also give one cent, **doubling the amount**.) 

The other half of subjects were randomly assigned to the Savings
Condition and were instead asked to divide the 30-cent bonus anyway they
wished between what they would receive soon after their study payment,
and what they would receive in three months (save). We manipulated
(between subjects) whether any money saved would be matched, multiplying
it. The match levels were no match or 1:1 match.

A subject in the Savings Condition who was assigned no match saw the
following text:

In addition to the 30 cents that you will be paid for participating, we
are giving you an additional 30 cents. You can choose to either earn
some or all of this 30 cents with your study payment, or **wait to
receive some or all of it in three months**.

How much of the 30 cents would you like to **receive in three months**?
(Total must sum to 30.) 

A subject in the Savings Condition who was assigned a 1:1 match saw the
following text:

In addition to the 30 cents that you will be paid for participating, we
are giving you an additional 30 cents. You can choose to either earn
some or all of this 30 cents with your study payment, or **wait to
receive some or all of it in three months**. For every one cent that you
give, we will also give one cent, so that **in three months you receive
double.  **

How much of the 30 cents would you like to **receive in three months**?
(Total must sum to 30. Recall that for every one cent that you give, we
will also give one cent, **doubling it**.) 

Subjects concluded the study by answering some standard demographic
questions and providing open-ended feedback on the survey.

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted amount saved or donated from whether
there was a multiplier (coded 0 = no multiplier, 1 = multiplier),
whether participants donated or saved (coded 0 = saved, 1 = donated),
and the interaction (multiplier\*donated or saved). As predicted, there
was a significant effect of the multiplier, Beta = 0.44, 95% CI \[0.32,
0.56\], *t*(501) = 7.38, *p* \< .001. We made no prediction about the
amount donated versus saved, but report the coeffective here for
completeness: Beta = 8.68, 95% CI for Beta \[0.22, 0.45\], *t*(501) =
5.58, *p* \<.001 (two-sided).

The predicted interaction was significant, such that the presence of a
match predicts savings more strongly than it predicts donations, Beta =
-0.36, 95% CI \[-0.51, -0.22\], *t*(501) = -4.95, *p* \< .001. The
pattern of means was as follows: donations: *M* = 13.72, *SD* = 12.64
for no match, *M* = 14.34, *SD* = 12.31 for 1:1 match; savings: *M* =
5.04, *SD* = 10.27 for no match, *M* = 16.50, *SD* = 13.69 for 1:1
match.

**Study 2: Donors' willingness to pay to prevent suffering is sensitive
to the scope of suffering when helping family members but not when
helping strangers**

**Experimental design overview.** Study 2 asked subjects what percentage
of their income they would give up to prevent one or five people from
going hungry for a year. These people were either members of their
family or unknown children in their country (strangers).

**Subjects**. Subjects were 606 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 36.00, SD = 11.99, range from 18 to 80). Participation was
limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 46% were male,
54% female. 72% were White/Caucasian, 8% African American, 6% Hispanic,
10% Asian American, 1% Native American, 2% marked "other," and 1% marked
"prefer not to say." 99% had graduated at least from high school, and
54% had graduated at least from college.

**Procedure.** Subjects were asked to imagine that either one or five
people would go hungry for a year (varied between subjects). These
people were described as either unknown children in the United States
(strangers), or members of their own family (also varied between
subjects). The text for the four conditions is included below.

Subjects asked to imagine one unknown child going hungry saw the
following text:

**Imagine that you learned that a child in the United States was going
to go hungry for a year. Really imagine this child. Every day for a
year, this child will be hungry. All year this child will never get
enough to eat. **

Subjects asked to imagine five unknown children going hungry saw the
following text:

**Imagine that you learned that five children in the United States were
going to go hungry for a year. Really imagine these children. Every day
for a year, these five children will be hungry. All year these children
will never get enough to eat. **

Subjects asked to imagine one family member going hungry saw the
following text:

**Imagine that you learned that a member of your family was going to go
hungry for a year. Really imagine this family member. Every day for a
year, this family member will be hungry. All year this family member
will never get enough to eat. **

Subjects asked to imagine five family members going hungry saw the
following text:

**Imagine that you learned that five members of your family were going
to go hungry for a year. Really imagine these five family members. Every
day for a year, these family members will be hungry. All year these
family members will never get enough to eat. **

Subjects were then asked how much of their income they would be willing
to give up to prevent this from happening. The text for this question
was as follows (participants answered using a slider bar that went from
0 percent to 100 percent):

What percentage of your income during that year would you be willing to
give up to prevent this from happening (assuming that no one else could
prevent it)?

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted the percentage of their income that
subjects reported being willing to pay from whether the hungry victims
were strangers or family members (coded 0 = strangers, 1 = family
members), whether there was one victim or five (0 = one victim, 1 =
five), and the interaction (victim status \* number). As predicted,
there was a significant effect of whether the victim was a stranger or a
family member, Beta = 0.41, 95% CI \[0.32, 0.51\], *t*(604) = 8.54, *p*
\< .001. We made no prediction about the overall effect of whether there
was one versus five victims, but report the coeffective here for
completeness: Beta = -0.01, 95% CI for Beta \[-0.11, 0.08\], *t*(604) =
-0.29, *p* =.769 (two-sided).

As Figure 2 shows, the predicted interaction was significant, such that
subjects were not willing to donate more of their income to save five
strangers from hunger than they were willing to donate to save one, but
they were willing to donate more of their income to save five family
members from hunger than they were willing to donate to save one, Beta =
0.20, 95% CI \[0.08, 0.32\], *t*(604) = 3.36, *p* \< .001. The pattern
of means was: strangers: *M* = 14.31, *SD* = 15.55 for one, *M* = 13.54,
*SD* = 15.67 for five; family: *M* = 36.83, *SD* = 28.34 for one, *M* =
48.55, *SD* = 28.79 for five.

**Study 3: Reputational Rewards Are Sensitive to Giving but Insensitive
to Giving with a Multiplier**

**Experimental design overview.** Study 3 tested whether donors were
rewarded more for donating to charity when it did more good (the
donation was multiplied), and whether it cost participants to refrain
from donating when their donation could have done more good (when the
donation would have been multiplied). Donors were given a 30-cent bonus
that they could either keep or donate to charity. Donations were
assigned a match ranging from no match to 9:1.

Subjects were paired with a donor and told the match rate for that donor
and whether the donor had donated or kept their 30-cent bonus. Subjects
then then had the opportunity to pay to reward the donor.

**Study 3a. No match and 1:1 match**

**Subjects**. Subjects were 221 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 35.85, SD = 11.27, range from 18 to 69). Participation was
limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 52% were male,
48% female. 78% were White/Caucasian, 7% African American, 5% Hispanic,
9% Asian American, and 1% Native American. 99% had graduated at least
from high school, and 54% had graduated at least from college. One
subject did not answer all relevant questions needed for the primary
analyses. We also ran 30 donors to pair with subjects (we paired
multiple subjects with a donor), so that the study could be fully
incentivized.

**Procedure.** Subjects selected their top choice charity from the same
list used in Study 1a: The American Cancer Society, The Ocean
Conservancy, World Animal Protection, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, the
Society for the Improvement of the Conditions of Stray Animals, and The
Nature Conservancy. Subjects then read about a donor who selected their
top charity from the same list and had the choice to donate or keep all
of a bonus. We manipulated (between subjects) whether we paired subjects
with a donor who chose to donate or keep the bonus, and whether this
donor was told that their bonus would be matched 1:1 if they donated
(compared to no match being used or mentioned).

A subject paired with a donor who chose to keep the bonus when donations
would not be matched saw the following text:

For the next part of this study, we are pairing you with another MTurk
worker who saw the same list of charities that you saw, and had the
opportunity to donate a 30 cent bonus to the charity that they selected
as their top choice. They had a choice between two options: donate the
entire 30 cent bonus to their top charity, or keep the entire 30 cent
bonus for themselves. **This other MTurk worker decided to keep the
entire 30 cent bonus for themself.**

donated, we would match their donation 1:1, doubling it,** so that their
top charity received 60 cents. **This other MTurk worker decided to
donate the entire 30 cent bonus to their top charity.**

After reading about this donor's decision, subjects were given a bonus
of 30 cents and had the opportunity to pay some or all of this bonus to
reward the donor. To give subjects some incentive to reward, they were
informed that every cent that they paid would be tripled, such that the
donor received three cents. Participants indicated how many cents (up to
30) they would like to pay to reward the donor. We also asked
participants a series of questions about the donor's character (rated on
7-point Likert scale): how generous, giving, good a person, ethical,
moral, and deserving of praise the donor was, and how much the donor
cares about helping others and cares about charitable causes.

Subjects concluded the study by answering some standard demographic
questions and giving open-ended feedback on the survey.

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted the amount subjects paid to reward
the donor from whether the donor donated (coded 0 = kept bonus, 1 =
donated bonus), whether there was a multiplier (coded 0 = no multiplier,
1= multiplier), and the interaction (donated\*multiplier). As predicted,
there was a significant effect of whether the donor donated, Beta =
0.38, 95% CI \[0.21, 0.55\], *t*(218) = 4.42, *p* \< .001. Also as
expected, there was no significant effect of the multiplier, Beta =
0.04, 95% CI \[-0.14, 0.22\], *t*(218) = 0.46, *p* = .645 (two-sided),
and no significant interaction between whether subjects donated and
whether there was a multiplier, Beta = -0.03, 95% CI \[-0.24, 0.19\],
*t*(218) = -0.27, *p* = .788 (two-sided). The pattern of means for
amount paid to reward (in cents) was: did not donate: *M* = 4.68, *SD* =
8.75 for no match, *M* = 5.64, *SD* = 10.79 for 1:1 match; donated: *M*
= 13.58, *SD* = 11.70 for no match, *M* = 13.76, *SD* = 12.24 for 1:1
match.

In addition, the eight character questions were standardized and
averaged into an average character judgment index (alpha = .974). As
predicted, there was a significant effect of whether the partner donated
on subjects' judgments of the partner's character, Beta = 0.71, 95% CI
\[0.59, 0.84\], *t*(218) = 11.12, *p* \< .001. Also as expected, there
was no significant effect of the multiplier, Beta = -0.04, 95% CI
\[-0.17, 0.09\], *t*(218) = -0.60, *p* = .551 (two-sided), and no
significant interaction between whether subjects donated and whether
there was a multiplier, Beta = 0.02, 95% CI \[-0.14, 0.18\], *t*(218) =
0.22, *p* = .826 (two-sided). The pattern of means for standardized
average character judgments was: did not donate: *M* = -0.65, *SD* =
0.58 for no match; *M* = -0.72, *SD* = 0.71 for 1:1 match; donated: *M*
= 0.67, *SD* = 0.58 for no match, *M* = 0.63, *SD* = 0.74 for 1:1 match.

**Validating that subjects discriminate between the relevant donation
amounts**

To validate that participants could cognitively process the difference
between the amount donated with and without a match in Study 3, we
recruited a separate sample (*N* = 103) from Amazon Mechanical Turk and
asked subjects how many days they would wait to receive a 60 cent bonus
instead of a 30 cent bonus. These participants indicated that they would
wait an average of 16.24 days for the doubled bonus (*SD* = 10.96),
one-sample *t*-test *t*(101) = 16.24, *p* \< .001.

**Study 3b. No match through 1:9**

**Subjects**. Subjects were 545 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 34.58, SD = 10.84, range from 18 to 73). Participation was
limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 48% were male,
50% female, 1% preferred not to indicate sex. 75% were White/Caucasian,
8% African American, 7% Hispanic, 7% Asian American, and 1% Native
American, 2% were another race/ethnicity or preferred not to indicate
their race/ethnicity. 98% had graduated at least from high school, and
56% had graduated at least from college. Three subjects did not answer
all relevant questions needed for the primary analyses. We also ran 61
donors to pair with subjects (we paired multiple subjects with a donor),
so that the study could be fully incentivized.

**Procedure.** The procedure was identical to that for study 3a, except
that instead of using only two match levels donors were assigned a match
ranging from none to 1:9.

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted the amount subjects paid to reward
the donor from whether the donor donated (coded 0 = kept bonus, 1 =
donated bonus), the multiplier (from 1 to 10), and the interaction
(donated\*multiplier). As predicted, there was a significant effect of
whether the donor donated, Beta = 0.24, 95% CI \[0.06, 0.41\], *t*(538)
= 2.67, *p* = .004 (see Figure 3). Also as expected, there was no
significant effect of the multiplier, Beta = -0.05, 95% CI \[-0.17,
0.06\], *t*(218) = -0.92, *p* = .358 (two-sided), and no significant
interaction between whether subjects donated and whether there was a
multiplier, regression Beta = 0.07, 95% CI \[-0.12, 0.26\], *t*(538) =
-0.42, *p* = .868.

In addition, the eight character questions were standardized and
averaged into an average character judgment index (alpha = 975). As
predicted, there was a significant effect of whether the partner donated
on subjects' judgments of the partner's character, Beta = 0.60, 95% CI
\[0.47, 0.73\], *t*(528) = 8.75, *p* \< .001. Also as expected, there
was no significant effect of the multiplier, Beta = -0.08, 95% CI
\[-0.17, 0.003\], *t*(528) = -1.87, *p* = .062 (two-sided), and no
significant interaction between whether subjects donated and whether
there was a multiplier, Beta = 0.09, 95% CI \[-0.06, 0.24\], *t*(528) =
1.18, *p* = .239 (two-sided).

**Study 4:** **Reputational Rewards Are Sensitive to Giving but
Insensitive to Amount Given**

**Experimental design overview.** Study 4 tested whether donors were
rewarded more for donating to charity when they donated twice as much.
Donors were given a bonus of either 10 cents or 20 cents that they could
either keep or donate to charity. Subjects then had the opportunity to
pay to reward donors who: donated a 10 cent bonus, did not donate a 10
cent bonus, donated a 20 cent bonus, did not donate a 20 cent bonus.

**Subjects**. Subjects were 422 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 35.50, SD = 11.82, range from 18 to 72). Participation was
limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 47% were male,
53% female. 77% were White/Caucasian, 6% African American, 7% Hispanic,
7% Asian American, 1% Native American, 2% marked "other." 98% had
graduated at least from high school, and 50% had graduated at least from
college. One subjects did not answer all relevant questions needed for
the analyses. We also ran 114 donors to pair with subjects (we paired
multiple subjects with each donor), so that the study could be fully
incentivized.

**Procedure.** Subjects selected their top choice charity from the same
list used in Study 1: The American Cancer Society, The Ocean
Conservancy, World Animal Protection, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, the
Society for the Improvement of the Conditions of Stray Animals, and The
Nature Conservancy. Subjects then read about a donor who selected their
top charity from the same list and had the choice to donate or keep all
of a bonus. We manipulated (between subjects) whether we paired subjects
with a donor who chose to donate or keep the bonus, and whether this
donor's bonus was 10 cents or 20 cents.

A subject paired with a donor who chose to keep the bonus when the bonus
was 10 cents saw the following text:

For the next part of this study, we are pairing you with another MTurk
worker who saw the same list of charities that you saw, and had the
opportunity to donate a 10 cent bonus to the charity that they selected
as their top choice. They had a choice between two options: donate the
entire 10 cent bonus to their top charity, or keep the entire 10 cent
bonus for themselves. **This other MTurk worker decided to keep the
entire 10 cent bonus for themself.**

A subject paired with a donor who chose to donate the bonus when the
bonus was 10 cents saw the following text:

After reading about this donor's decision, subjects were given a bonus
of 30 cents and had the opportunity to pay some or all of this bonus to
reward the donor. To give subjects some incentive to reward, they were
informed that every cent that they paid would be tripled, such that the

questions about the donor's character (rated on 7-point Likert scale):
how generous, giving, good a person, ethical, moral, and deserving of
praise the donor was, and how much the donor cares about helping others
and cares about charitable causes.

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted the amount subjects paid to reward
the donor from whether the donor donated (coded 0 = kept bonus, 1 =
donated bonus), the size of the bonus (coded 0 = 10 cents, 1= 20 cents),
and the interaction (donated\*bonus size). As predicted, there was a
significant effect of whether the donor donated, Beta = 0.25, 95% CI
\[0.12, 0.38\], *t*(419) = 3.70, *p* \< .001 (see Figure 4). Also as
expected, there was no significant effect of bonus size, Beta = 0.07,
95% CI \[-0.06, 0.20\], *t*(419) = 1.00, *p* = .322 (two-sided), and no
significant interaction between whether the donor donated and whether
there was a multiplier, Beta = 0.04, 95% CI \[-0.12, 0.20\], *t*(419) =
0.51, *p* = .608 (two-sided). The patterns of means for the amounts paid
to reward (in cents) was: did not donate: *M* = 5.38, *SD* = 9.18 for 10
cents, *M* = 6.83, *SD* = 10.04 for 20 cents; donated: *M* = 10.84, *SD*
= 11.18 for 10 cents, *M* = 13.35, *SD* = 11.93 for 20 cents.

In addition, the eight character questions were standardized and
averaged into an average character judgment index (alpha = .967). As
predicted, there was a significant effect of whether the donor donated
on subjects' judgments of the donor's character, Beta = 0.54, 95% CI
\[0.43, 0.65\], *t*(419) = 9.72, *p* \< .001. Also as expected, there
was no significant effect of bonus size, Beta = -0.01, 95% CI \[-0.12,
0.10\], *t*(419) = -0.15, *p* = .881 (two-sided), and no significant
interaction between whether subjects donated and the size of the bonus,
Beta = 0.11, 95% CI \[-0.02, 0.24\], *t*(419) = 1.67, *p* = .095
(two-sided). The pattern of means for average standardized character
judgments was: did not donate: *M* = -0.53, *SD* = 0.73 for 10 cents,
*M* = -0.55, *SD* = 0.76 for 20 cents; donated: *M* = 0.43, *SD* = 0.68
for 10 cents, *M* = 0.65, *SD* = 0.70 for 20 cents.

**Validating that subjects discriminate between the relevant donation
amounts**

To verify that participants could discriminate the difference between
the donation amounts, we recruited a separate sample (*N* =103) from the
same pool, and asked them (between subjects) how many days they would
wait to receive a 10 cent bonus or a 20 cent bonus. These participants
indicated that they would wait an average of 2.67 days longer for the 20
cent bonus, *t*(199) = 1.79, *p* = .038.

**Study 5:** **Reputational Rewards Are Sensitive to Giving but
Insensitive to Percent Given**

**Experimental design overview.** Study 5 tested whether donors were
rewarded more for donating to charity when they donated a greater
percent of their available funds. Donors were given a bonus of either 75
cents or 90 cents that they could either keep or donate some portion of
to charity. Subjects then then had the opportunity to pay to reward
donors who: donated 60 cents out of a 75 cent bonus, did not donate any
of a 75 cent bonus, donated 60 cents out of a 90 cent bonus, did not
donate any of a 90 cent bonus.

**Subjects**. Subjects were 401 respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk
(mean age = 35.53, SD = 11.73, range from 18 to 74). Participation was
limited to subjects from the United States and Canada. 55% were male,
44% female, and 1% marked other/prefer not to say. 70% were
White/Caucasian, 8% African American, 7% Hispanic, 11% Asian American,
1% Native American, 2% marked "other," and 1% marked "prefer not to
say." 99% had graduated at least from high school, and 57% had graduated
at least from college. One subject did not answer all relevant questions
needed for the primary analyses. We also ran 81 donors to pair with
subjects (we paired multiple subjects with each donor), so that the
study could be fully incentivized.

**Procedure.** Subjects selected their top choice charity from the same
list used in Study 1: The American Cancer Society, The Ocean
Conservancy, World Animal Protection, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, the
Society for the Improvement of the Conditions of Stray Animals, and The
Nature Conservancy. Subjects then read about a donor who selected their
top charity from the same list and had the choice to donate or keep some
or all of a bonus. We manipulated (between subjects) whether we paired
subjects with a donor who chose to donate 60 cents or keep the entire
bonus, and whether this donor's bonus was 75 cents or 90 cents.

A subject paired with a donor who chose to keep the entire bonus when
the bonus was 75 cents saw the following text:

For the next part of this study, we are pairing you with another MTurk
worker who saw the same list of charities that you saw, and had the
opportunity to donate some or all of a 75 cent bonus to the charity that

After reading about this donor's decision, subjects were given a bonus
of 30 cents and had the opportunity to pay some or all of this bonus to
reward the donor. To give subjects some incentive to reward, they were
informed that every cent that they paid would be tripled, such that the
potential donor received three cents. We also asked participants a

potential donor cares about helping others and cares about charitable
causes.

**Results**

We ran a regression that predicted the amount subjects paid to reward
the donor from whether the donor donated (coded 0 = kept bonus, 1 =
donated 60 cents of the bonus), the size of the bonus (coded 0 = 75
cents, 1= 90 cents), and the interaction (donated\*bonus size). As
predicted, there was a significant effect of whether the donor donated,
Beta = 0.27, 95% CI \[0.14, 0.40\], *t*(398) = 4.05, *p* \< .001 (see
Figure 4). Also as expected, there was no significant effect of bonus
size, Beta = -0.06, 95% CI \[-0.20, 0.07\], *t*(398) = -0.95, *p* = .341
(two-sided), and no significant interaction between whether the donor
donated and the bonus size, Beta = 0.09, 95% CI \[-0.08, 0.25\],
*t*(398) = 1.05, *p* = .294 (two-sided). The patterns of means for
amounts paid to reward (in cents) was: did not donate: *M* = 4.77, *SD*

= 10.50, *SD* = 11.11 for 75 cents, *M* = 11.26, *SD* = 11.59 for 90
cents.

In addition, the eight character questions were standardized and
averaged into an average character judgment index (alpha = .977). As
predicted, there was a significant effect of whether donors donated on
subjects' ratings of the donors' character, Beta = 0.74, 95% CI \[0.63,
0.84\], *t*(398) = 14.32, *p* \< .001. Also as expected, there was no

-0.10, 95% CI \[-0.21, 0.03\], *t*(398) = -1.43, *p* = .153 (two-sided).
The pattern of means for average standardized character judgments was:
did not donate: *M* = -0.63, *SD* = 0.76 for 75 cent bonus, *M* = -0.64,

[^1]: Note that we always requested round numbers of participants from
    Amazon Mechanical Turk (e.g., in this study we requested 300).
    However, we often received a few more participants than we
    requested, presumably because some participants completed our survey
    (which they reached through a link from Amazon Mechanical Turk) but
    did not enter the completion code into Amazon Mechanical Turk, and
    therefore were not counted by that system.

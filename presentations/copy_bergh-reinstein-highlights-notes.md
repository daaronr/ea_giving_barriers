In this article, we take a step back from normative arguments about what people should do, to consider an empirical question: What do donors actually do when facing empathy-invoking appeals and information that invites logical deliberation?


The description of empathy as innumerate fits the notion of an emotional heuristic (e.g., Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2007).

Like other spontaneous mental processes, empathic reactions are prone to cognitive biases (Bloom, 2016).

empathy for a particular person’s distress leaves one insensitive to the number of people who can be helped.


If empathy is innumerate, it should not only be insensitive to the numbers of victims but to any numerical information—such as the proportion of a charity’s revenue that goes to its programs (henceforth efficiency) and the ultimate outcomes these programs yield (henceforth effectiveness).



Some lab experiments provide evidence that people favor efficient charities in forced choice questions...  other studies suggest that people attend to efficiency information as a potential excuse for not to donate (Exley, 2015), and beliefs about effectiveness are colored by subjective preferences ... Further evidence suggests that people give based on a subjective sense of making a difference (e.g., when they can help a charity across the finish line with a fundraising goal; Cryder, Loewenstein, & Scheines, 2013; Cryder, Loewenstein, & Seltman, 2013...

Field experiments suggest that overall, donors do not contribute more overall when they are informed (vs. not informed) about either charity efficiency (Parsons, 2007) or effectiveness (Karlan & Wood, 2017).

Still, people might use more deliberate thinking when deciding how much to give...


We further considered whether combining an empathy-induction with efficiency/effectiveness information leads to greater donations than the empathy-induction on its own. In fact, the literature indicates a potential for a “negative” interaction,

Does the empathy-disruption occur for any deliberation or only for certain types of deliberation? For instance, spending cognitive resources on a task that is irrelevant for charitable giving may create a backlash for empathy-driven giving (see Small et al., 2007, Study 4), but deliberating on charity effectiveness may not do so.



... it remains unclear whether effects of empathy on donations also depend on information about how efficiently/effectively charities spend their money. This information may amplify empathy-based giving (as triggered by images of particular victims)—a “positive” interaction (similar to the findings for interpersonal helping behaviors). On the other hand, an evaluation of efficiency/effectiveness information may disrupt emotionally induced generosity—a “negative” interaction (similar to findings by Small et al., 2007, suggesting that analytic thinking decreases donations to identified victims).

We also [considered the main effects] ... We predicted that victim images increase donations [to the general group], particularly by increasing the willingness to donate anything (vs. nothing),
...
To the extent that efficiency/effectiveness information increases donations, it seems reasonable that this would instead impact amounts given. ... [simple two-stage modeling as well as  bounding techniques in appendix]


We aimed to have around 100 participants per experimental cell. The experiments were originally designed to examine effects of victim imagery and efficiency information for the whole range of donation amounts and powered accordingly. In ordinary least squares regression, we would have a power of .80 for detecting a weak effect (ΔR2 = .02) in a 2 × 2 between-subject design with 400 participants or .93 in a 2 × 3 design with 600 participants (estimated in GPower Version 3.1; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007). Taking all main and interactions into account, the power would have been .65 and .76. Given that the realized distribution of donations was trimodal (most people giving nothing, half, or everything), we updated some analytic procedures, leading to lower ex post power for some analyses. For example, analyzing midrange donation amounts (roughly normally distributed), and setting aside the minimum and maximum donations, the actual power to detect a small effect, given the current Ns, would be >.70 for one predictor and >.45 for all five predictors in the 2 × 3 design (all other analyses had better power). To get better estimates of effect sizes and confidence intervals (CIs), we also conducted mini meta-analyses (see Goh, Hall, & Rosenthal, 2016).


We examined whether predicted that information about efficiency or effectiveness (on its own) would provide a tuning mechanism for amounts to give. However, we found no positive effects at all for providing people with information about charity efficiency or effectiveness, with reasonably tight CIs on this null effect in our meta-analyses (similar results were also obtained with other analytic strategies, see Supplementary Materials). This clashes somewhat with previous work; others have manipulated similar factors and found effects. However, previous studies with “successful” manipulations involved hypothetical donations, forced choices between charities, and/or fairly extreme contrasts in efficiency or effectiveness (see, e.g., Caviola et al., 2014; Gneezy et al., 2014). We used naturalistic stimuli, real charity evaluations, and actual donation decisions. In these regard, our experiments are closer to the field experiments on this topic, which have also failed to find any overall effects of providing information about charity efficiency (Parsons, 2007) or effectiveness (Karlan & Wood, 2017).

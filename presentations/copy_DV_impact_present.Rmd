# Outline

1. The question


2. What previous research suggests


<aside class="notes">
<small>

1.  "How do people deal with impact/effectiveness info?, should you present it in solicitations?, why this is important"?
2. (mixed results, some positive, lack of clear evidence)
(7 experiments...  CRS to be presented soon 6 with Robin Bergh Harvard)

Hints at positive or null effects, little evidence of turn-off, worth further exploration

I'd like  work with you to run field experiments/trials through your standard platform, and to run trials with digital, social media, advertisements on your behalf, can co-finance with grants)

Overhead rate or fundraising is now widely seen to be a fairly uninformative measure of impact.

Transparency and financial stability are good, but far from sufficient to have impact. I can be a squeaky-clean provider of an intervention that has no positive impact (guns for tots?)

</aside>

## {data-background="gunsfortots.jpg"}


# Theory: should 'impact' drive giving or shut-down empathy?

```{block2,  type='note'}

<small><center>

Behavioral Economics idea/ideal: "impact-altruism"

'Innumerate empathy?'... cognitive biases, barriers to effectiveness

'Dual process' -  fast/slow thinking; 'spontaneous generosity vs. deliberative self-interest?'

 Relational models ... 'market vs sharing norms'

'Motivated reasoning', excuses not to give; double-edged

'Signaling' empathy vs effectiveness

</center>
</small>

```

<aside class="notes">

Effectiveness information might also help *remove* excuses

A small share of charitable giving goes towards “highly-effective” charities as measured by GiveWell (or to charities in this category: health interventions in poor countries).
*Innumerate empathy* may constitute a major barrier to (promoting) effective giving.

Previous work finds that helping behaviors are strongly driven by emotional reactions to individual suffering, but these do not scale with the magnitude of need. From a dual-process perspective, presenting analytical impact information may even disrupt empathic giving, shifting potential donors towards a system-II deliberative mode.

# The evidence: prior studies

## Claim: Better to portray an individual (child) than convey the total affected

<center> <small> Small & Loewenstein (03); Small et al (07); Kogut & R (05) </small> </center>

Driven by System-1 empathy, switched off by analytic thinking

<br>

. . .

**Small, Lowenstein, Slovic (2007):**

[Study 3] "individuals who faced an identifiable victim donated more..."


. . .

<small> "...than those who faced victim statistics, p < .01," </small>

. . .

<small>  ..."than those who faced [both] an identifiable victim [and] statistics, p < .05." </small>

<aside class="notes">
<small>	There is strong evidence that people offer more aid to specific, identifiable victims than anonymous, statistical victims (called the identified victim effect; see e.g., Kogut & Ritov, 2005; Lee & Feeley, 2016; Small, Loewenstein, & Slovic, 2007).

 “any money that you donate will go to Rokia [the identified victim]”
 </small>
</aside>


----

**Small et al, '07, Study 4**

<br>

> Priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime.

<br>

. . .

> Yet, the primes had no distinct effect on donations to statistical victims, which is symptomatic of the difficulty in generating feelings for these victims.

<br>

<center> <small> `r fwc("*Tightly bounded null, but ... nonlinearity?*","blue")` </small> </center>

<aside class="notes">

<small>
latter non-effect appears tightly bounded; but this could simply be driven by nonlinearity. If people gave little to statistical victims, there is less room for this to decrease further. A classic problem when considering interactions.

</small>

## Ratings and information in general: mixed evidence

. . .

- Completion $\rightarrow$ raffle for 1 of 20 Amazon vouchers worth £50 each

- Given information about blindness in general

- (Conditional) donation part

<aside class="notes">

Advantages over S1-5 (Mturk): Not a 'donation experiment,' real impact measures, distinct emotional simuli, choose between distinct *causes*, larger amounts, tied to rich Omnibus survey data

Note these are the later/non-British-nationality participants in the Omnibus.

## SPI/AFE abstract

`r format_with_col("Puzzle:","blue")` inefficient giving/little to highest-impact causes

- Conceptual breakdown of 'barriers'
- 'Innumerate empathy': key barrier to promoting effective giving?
  - Previous: emotional reactions to suffering $\rightarrow$ helping; but it "doesn't scale" with need (and few ppl 'research effectiveness before giving')

- Dual process: *analytical* impact info may disrupt empathic giving

*7 giving experiments, various contexts*, 2x2, between-subject treatments

- Measures of charity efficiency/effectiveness
- Emotional-empathy-inducing images


*Results:* <small> Analytical info doesn't seem to disrupt emotional-empathic giving (but some lack of power), and may enhance it.  The 'right' empathic images can drive effective giving. </small>


<aside class="notes">

A small share of charitable giving goes towards “highly-effective” charities as measured by GiveWell (or to charities in this category: health interventions in poor countries).
*Innumerate empathy* may constitute a major barrier to (promoting) effective giving.

Previous work finds that helping behaviors are strongly driven by emotional reactions to individual suffering, but these do not scale with the magnitude of need. From a dual-process perspective, presenting analytical impact information may even disrupt empathic giving, shifting potential donors towards a system-II deliberative mode. We report on seven charitable giving experiments. Treatments (between subjects, mainly 2x2) present (i) measures of charity efficiency/effectiveness and (ii) empathy-inducing images. Variations across experiments include: subject pools (MTurk, UK students, US regular donors via direct mail),  separate vs. joint evaluation, the nature of the effectiveness information, and treatment ordering/timing.

# Definition of 'effective giving' for our purposes, motivation {#intro .flexbox .vcenter}

## Definition {#def-impact}

*Impact* aka *effectiveness* of a charity

$B(G_i)$: Beneficial *outcome* achieved by charity $i$ with total donations $G_i$

<br>

- *Ultimate outcome* --  Lives saved, QALY added, etc.

- Not *'output'* -- 'nets provided' nor 'paintings purchased'

<aside class="notes">

(Total or marginal) impact per dollar = output per dollar $\times$ impact per output

</aside>

----

*Impact* of a donation:

$B'(G_i)$ for the marginal donor

- GiveWell and others attempt to measure this

<br>

<center>

*We know:*

$B'(G_i)$  is much larger for most *impactful* vs. most *popular* charities.

<aside class="notes">

Trust me on this, or at least accept that this seems likely in many cases.

- Heuristic (fast) $\rightarrow$ spontaneous generosity?

- Deliberative (slow) $\rightarrow$ thoughtful giving ... or 'calculated greed'

-  Also: relational models theory <small> (Fisk, '91)</small>; Motivated reasoning <small> (e.g., Exley '19) </small> $\rightarrow$ all suggests analytical information $\rightarrow$ less giving

<!-- ##  Concepts/theory {#concepts}
-->

<aside class="notes">
Spontaneous Emotions and Deliberation: Dual-Process Perspectives
What happens when we combine emotional and reasoning appeals?

Dual process models of prosocial behaviors:

theoretical arguments for this perspective comes from other research on generosity and cooperativeness, suggesting that people are spontaneously prosocial and more self-serving when they think longer/more (e.g., Rand et al., 2012, Rand, 2016).

cf Fisk: Relational models theory (x1991 ) ... all thinking about social relationships is based on four elementary mental models: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing.

Alt. channel: Exley, Motivated reasoning: ' ...if participants desire to keep money for themselves and to think of themselves as generous, they may overweight their dislike of less-than-perfect performance metrics as an excuse not to give.'

Claim: Better to portray an individual (child) than convey the total affected <small> Small & Loewenstein (03); Small et al (07); Kogut & R (05) </small>

- Driven by System-1 empathy, switched off by analytic thinking

----

**Small, Lowenstein, Slovic (2007):**

<br>

[Study 3] "individuals who faced an identifiable victim donated more..."

<br>

> - "...than those who faced victim statistics, p < .01,"

<br>

> - ..."than those who faced [both] an identifiable victim [and] statistics, p < .05.""

----

**Small et al, '07, Study 4**

<br>

> Priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime.

<br>

> Yet, the primes had no distinct effect on donations to statistical victims, which is symptomatic of the difficulty in generating feelings for these victims.

<br>

<center> <small> `r format_with_col("*Tightly bounded null, but ... nonlinearity?*","blue")` </small> </center>

<aside class="notes">

Note, the latter non-effect appears tightly bounded; but this could simply be driven by nonlinearity. If people gave little to statistical victims, there is less room for this to decrease further. A classic problem when considering interactions.

**Verkaik (2016)**

<br>

> While previous studies have convincingly shown that providing output information, informing donors of how their donation is used, increases generosity <small> (Cryder & L, '10; Cryder ea '13; Aknin ea '13) </small>

<aside class="notes">
Robin: I personally wouldn't count the Cryder studies as examples of studies demonstrating that effectiveness has a positive effect on giving. There's a fundamental difference between psychological perceptions of impact (and "tweaks" of info to make it seem more impactful to donate) versus evaluating actual evidence of effectiveness. For instance, the fact that donors are more willing to donate when a fundraiser is close to reaching a goal tells us something about how people feel about donating, but it tells us absolutely nothing about the actual effectiveness of a charity and how people process such information. Effectiveness is an attribute of the charity, not a perception of making a difference (if we reduce effectiveness to a subjective impact belief then guide dogs could also argued to be highly effective).

DR: True;  But I wouldn't say it is completely unrelated. For actual cost-effectiveness/impact information to be used to increase/improve giving we presumably need both

1. Individuals care about their own impact per \$, as they perceive it (Cryder speaks to this),2. Individuals can reasonably draw conclusions about effectiveness per \$ from the information properly presented, and 3. The presentation of this information does not itself substantially reduce the actualized motivation to give,

**Details of Karlan first wave: SCIENCE vs EMOTION**


> According to studies on our programs in Peru that used rigorous scientific methodologies, women who have received both loans and business education saw their profits grow, even when compared to women who just received loans for their businesses. But the real difference comes when times are slow. The study showed that women in Freedom from Hunger's Credit with Education program kept their profits strong–ensuring that their families would not suffer, but thrive.

<br>

> Because of caring people like you, Freedom from Hunger was able to offer Sebastiana a self-help path toward achieving her dream of getting “a little land to farm” and pass down to her children. As Sebastiana's young son, Aurelio, runs up to hug her, she says, “I do whatever I can for my children.”

**Metzger & G, '19 **

Lab donations to high/low-performing NGO

- More purchasing of 'recipient type' than 'impact' info

- Mixed & weak evidence on excuse-driven information-seeking

<br>

<center>`r format_with_col("Caveats...","blue")` </center>

<aside class="notes">

Opportunity to buy info on 'recipient type' increased giving, on 'admin costs' decreased giving (marginal significance for both), no effect of 'aid impact' but wide CI

'Free info' on each of these had insignificant effects (underpowered!)

Lots of caveats; e.g., recipient type (artists vs children) may have been seen as a proxy for impact

</aside>

<!--
In a laboratory experiment, we analyze individuals’ demand for information about a donation’s welfare impact, and compare it with demand for information on recipient types and administrative costs. We find the least demand for information about aid impact, indicating that individuals either do not understand, do not trust, or do not care about the specific information we provide. Average donations increase in response to information about the recipient type and decrease in response to information about administrative costs. Information about aid impact does not significantly change average donations: donors who demand information respond positively to high impact projects and negatively to low impact projects, resulting in a zero net effect on donation levels. Our results further show that information has the same effect on donation behavior regardless of whether it is provided for free or at a cost.
-->

<!-- "Making an impact? The relevance of information on aid effectiveness for charitable giving. A laboratory experiment.":

>...the demand for information about aid impact is lowest, and it is highest for information about the recipient type.

> ... exact information about aid impact did not lead to a significant change in average donation levels, while information about the exact recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in donation levels.

> In the recipient type group, informed participants donated significantly more than uninformed participants because they "rewarded" the preferred recipient with higher-than-average transfers. In the administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly less than uninformed participants because they used the information to "punish" NGOs with high administration costs.

DR: It is not clear to me when they are reporting on the self-selected groups and when they report on the sample overall, or in a way that deals with the self-selection.

Looking at their one clearer result, we see a lack of power.

Average don:    2.45 CHF

Aid impact group coef: -.231 (.45)

This looks like an underpowered study. They can perhaps rule out an effect greater than around half of the average donation, but no more precisely.

## Our empirical approach {#empirical-approach}


- Naturalistic environments

- Robustness across setups/frames

- Honest presentation of evidence, allowing integration

<aside class="notes">
This is a project and not just a (set of) papers.
The general project is a practical one (although Bergh's project aims to explore into specific mechanisms).
By measuring the impact of several types of efficiency information, across several contexts, we aim to produce a fairly robust picture. We expect heterogeneity and sensitivity to frames; thus results may vary, and we will carefully examine the overall picture as well as  this variation in a 'mini-meta-analysis'.
To limit various types of experimenter demand and arbitrary coherence, these experiments are *between* participant, and (largely) run in contexts where the donation is not the focus of the interaction.
We have preregistered our studies, hypotheses and analyses.
We will share all of our data to enable future reanalyses.

# DonorsVoice mailing experiment  {#dv-experiment}

<small>
Co-authors:  David Reinstein, Elizabeth Keenan, Ayelet Gneezy, Hengchen Dai, Enrico Rubaltelli, Stephan Dickert, Kiki Koutmeridou, and Peter Ayton
</small>

## Plans from prereg [OSF---link](https://osf.io/ucwm3):

> What is the impact of including 'information about the per-dollar impact'  of a charity (in terms of services provided) on the average donation (equivalently, total amount raised) and the donation incidence rate?

----

> We are running this subject to the final say of the charity. We have proposed that the Treatment emails (but not the control emails) will include a sentence/fragment such as the following in both a captioned photo in the email, and the email text:

> "Last year, we were able to provide [general provision of an outcome here relevant to the charity] to a [recipient unit] with just $[small amount of money]."

----

<center> (from prereg) </center>

> We plan to perform standard nonparametric statistical tests of the effect of this treatment on

- Average gift amount (including zeroes)
- Incidence/number of people making a gift, [and]
- Incidence of gifts of exactly $10.

>  In particular, we will focus on Fisher's exact test (for incidence) and the standard rank sum and t-tests for the donation amounts.

----

**Power calculations**

> Response rates in previous such emails were extremely low: approximately 1 per 3,000 emails. Our power calculations suggest that we have .29 power to detect a 50% effect, and 0.90 power to detect approximately a 100% (doubling) on incidence...

> Because of this limited power, we will ask the charity to run this trial a second time with an equivalent-sized sample.

----

**Stopping rule**

> We aim to continue this treatment in future charity appeals until we can statistically bound (with 95% confidence) the impact of the treatment on both incidence and average donation within a margin of 1/3 of the incidence and average donation in the control condition.

**Cost (Impact/\$) information treatment $\rightarrow$**

1. Slightly lower rate of opened emails:

- 16816/91298  (18.4%) in control vs 16105/91296 in treatment (17.6%)
- Highly significant in Fisher's exact test ($p<0.001$)

<br>

2. Slightly (insignificantly) lower rate of click-through after opening

- 2.3% vs 2.5% (95% OR: 0.81, 1.08)


<aside class="notes">

Headers were identical but people may 'peek' at content in some email systems, I believe.

Karlan Because there are outliers in the dependent variable, we use four methods to examine robustness to different functional forms: simple amount donated, amount donated winsorized at $1000 (which constitutes the 99.8th percentile), and the inverse hyperbolic sine of the amount donated (because log of amount donated would drop those who did not donate).
Note: if we can get 'last amount donated' this would be good.

  - $\approx$ 20 minutes, many psycho/demog/polit/econ questions, mostly unrelated to charity

- Completion $\rightarrow$ raffle for 1 of 20 Amazon vouchers worth £50 each

- Given information about blindness in general

Advantages over S1-5 (Mturk): Not a 'donation experiment,' real impact measures, distinct emotional simuli, choose between distinct *causes*, larger amounts, tied to rich Omnibus survey data

# Preliminary conclusions, future directions (time permitting) {#conclusion}

## Preliminary take-aways: Don't fear the info

1. "Images work"

<small> Image treatments can be effective at motivating giving, including *impactful, efficient* giving </small>

<br>

2. "Info doesn't hurt, may help":

<small> Analytic information about impact:

Does not seem to (strongly) decrease donations

May increase donations in some cases (Donor's voice mailing; other authors' work)

Mixed evidence on 'efficiency info dampening the impact of identified victim images'

$\rightarrow$ this may not be a 'major barrier' to promoting effective giving

Caveats: More power needed, cannot rule out substantial effects </small>


<center> Larger-scale field trials examining responses to real impact-per-\$ information, in various presentations  </center>

## Future directions

- Followup with religious-affiliated charity

- Integrate motivated reasoning/excuse-driven

- Meta-analyses and systematic review including our own and others' work

Description
===========

*1-4 sentence description/definition of the barrier*

(For a given per-dollar impact on the outcome), people are be less
willing to donate towards a cause when the magnitude of the underlying
problem is (framed as) larger. \[Move to mechanisms: A certain amount of
impact (e.g., relieving suffering) is perceived as smaller and thus less
valuable when the underlying problem is larger.\]

Conceptual Discussion:
======================

*Overview of findings from papers, caveats, how the concept works, etc.
Provides context for evidence section; Discussion of the relevant
mechanisms at play; Discussion of the relevant established theories*

**Brief on the evidence here**

*[Definitional issues and disambiguation]{.underline}*

This needs to be distinguished from scope insensitivity. Note that if
people are being analytical, they must *care* about scope in order to
care about their impact, and thus (mistakenly) react to the perceived
lower impact of donating when the needs are much greater.

PD arguments may also be used as vehicle for motivated reasoning, and
thus not be an important driver in itself: E.g., I don't want to donate
so I focus on my impact being a share of the overwhelming need (which I
might opportunistically define broadly) to conclude that helping is
futile.[^1]

To operationalize this, we need to define what the numerator and
denominator represent. For the numerator, an (EA) impact-driven
individualist donor might consider of her *own* contribution (per dollar
or overall) relative to the size of the need. In contrast, a more
collectivist/team-reasoning/communitarian thinker might consider the
impact of the *total* expected donation relative to the size of the
need. We also need to better define the denominator; how do individuals
lump together different groups/problems to define the overall scale of
the need, and how sensitive is this to the fundraisers' framing?

*[Mechanisms]{.underline}*

Fetherstonhaugh et al (1997) highlight "Weber's law": Humans are
sensitive to proportional changes/proportional differences in stimuli
(loudness, brightness, etc); thus we are less sensitive to small changes
relative to a larger baseline. There is evidence this also holds in
assessing losses of life. \... the "subjective value of saving the
specified number of lives is greater for a smaller tragedy than for a
larger one" .

Baron attributes PD to quantity confusion and classifies this as
"contamination by an irrelevant factor"; more generally, this could be
seen in terms of *innumeracy*.

This may lead to a lower willingness to contribute to a problem when the
apparent scale (or "denominator") of the problem is larger (e.g., more
lives at risk), holding constant the benefit per dollar contributed
(cost per life saved). The *perceived* scale of the problem may depend
on how it is framed by fundraisers, charities, and the media. However,
this may not be completely manipulable: e.g., massive global problems
may not be easy to "frame down."

"Loewenstein and Small (2007) suggested that the PDE is driven by
increased sympathy towards the victims when one can help a large
proportion of the victim reference-group." \-- Erlandsson et al

EG Relevance
============

*How this particular barrier proves problematic for effective giving*

This effect represents a general departure from appropriate assessment
of the marginal benefit (per cost) of a particular charity/intervention.
Thus this is a general barrier to accurate assessment of effectiveness
ergo a barrier to effective giving.

In addition, it might be argued that more effective interventions (e.g.,
targeting poor Africans versus US poverty) may tend to address problems
that are inherently larger in scale and magnitude. These may be
intrinsically harder to "frame down", implying EG will suffer more from
this bias.

State of Evidence
=================

*Key papers: Summarize findings and key takeaways, Short description of
methods for relevant studies, Make sure to include both description of
evidence and evaluation of evidence*

**Fetherstonhaugh et al 1997** (notes
[[HERE]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHaF4phpqthCEwwNdgd_QBZp5np0pHwHEJm3U2G1cxA/edit#heading=h.8ax2rgfz70of))

[Methods]{.underline}

Range of hypothetical scenariae and evaluations, within-subject
manipulations only (with clear contrasts), framed as aid/targeting not
charitable donations, standard (mostly Economics) student subject pools.

These authors conducted survey experiments on standard (fairly small
sample?) student participants. They presented a variety of hypothetical
scenariae (e.g., "imagine themselves as a government official of a
small, developing country"\...), asking for ratings, rankings, etc.

[Findings]{.underline}

\> Studies 1 and 2 found that an intervention saving a fixed number of
lives was judged significantly more beneficial when fewer lives were at
risk overall. Study 3 found that respondents wanted the minimum number
of lives a medical treatment would have to save to merit a fixed amount
of funding to be much greater for a disease with a larger number of
potential victims than for a disease with a smaller number.

[Evaluation of paper's evidence:]{.underline}

Strengths - Reasonably realistic frames, (mostly) consistent results
across a variety of frames

Limitations - Hypothetical, framed, nonrepresentative, and does not
directly address *own* contributions

Within-subject treatments here:

(+) allow estimation of heterogeneous responses,

(+/-) highlight the difference in denominators/proportions, making them
salient; but this might also be expected to be an inhibitor of this
(seemingly non-rational) effect, especially for the Economics-trained
sample

Statistical tests (ANOVA) appear strong and highly significant in most
cases, but further investigation warranted (e.g., pre-registration?
Evidence of specification fishing and MHT?)

[Evaluation of evidence (Study 4):]{.underline}

Strengths - Realistic charity frame, reasonable implementation of
small/large "reference group" frames, outcomes record both
intentional/attitudinal and actual (small) donation measures

Limitations - A choice *among* charities only

Statistical tests -

manipulations only; standard student subject pools, small samples.

S1: Questions about (hypothetical wtp for components of government
government health insurance. "\[Denominator\] people die from this
disease each year. Their average age is 60. How much are you willing to
pay to cover a treatment that will save the lives of \[Numerator\] of
these people?"\... (Numerator=90 or 900; Denominator=100, 1000, or
10,000), all combinations presented to all participants.

S2: Set of causes, each gave wtp for a government program for a 5%
reduction in that cause of death and for saving 2,600 lives, also rating
prevalence and importance. He reports a very high correlation between
wtp by these two measures, an "insensitivity to quantity", and both wtp
measures are higher when subjects report a higher prevalence (even
controlling for stated importance).

[Evaluation of paper's evidence]{.underline}: This evidence appears
highly limited. There is some evidence that denominators matter when
they (arguably) should not, and participants show confusion between
proportions and absolute amounts. The second experiment is highly
cognitively demanding and participants have no strong incentive to "get
this right." The first experiment has arguable confounds: e.g., one
might question the scientific credibility of the treatment that (claims
to) save only a small number of lives out of a very large population.
The evidence does not seem to offer much strength over and above the
Fetherstonhaugh paper. I also found much of the statistical reporting to
be incomplete or unclear, especially for study two. In general, this is,
at its best, evidence of quantitative confusion which may go in either
direction in any given context.

It is also detached from the charity realm, considering the domain of
government expenditure and benefits that will accrue to the participant
him or herself. For this reason, I listed it is tangential evidence and
not charity specific evidence.

\> PN was investigated by varying the supposed number of brak-

as a way of exploring whether PN responding is the result of careless or

conventional braking systems to be approximately 41,000 (\"large
problem\") or 9,000 (\"small problem\").

Outcome measures:

-   \"support-for-intervention\", 7-point scale

-   "Lives-to-save" "What is the minimum number of these (9,000/41,000)

Treatments started with one size, then presented a "task force\'s new
estimate" with the reverse.

Solutions
=========

1.  Framing

    a.  Frame down denominator (suggestive evidence from
        > Fetherstonhaugh, etc)

    b.  Report absolute or proportional number of lives that could be
        > saved by an intervention depending on which suggests a smaller
        > denominator (how do you know?)

    c.  Highlight numerator (impact) (evidence?)

    d.  (Ari:) "Increase evaluability: putting interventions on same
        > page instead of separate pages"

2.  De-biasing (discussed further in Friedrich et al - expand)

*Consider:*

-   *"The proportion dominance effect was primarily mediated by
    > perceived impact." (Erlandsson et al, 2015, OBHDP)*

-   *"Perceived Utility (not Sympathy) Mediates the Proportion Dominance
    > Effect in Helping Decisions" (Erlandsson et al, 2013)*

*Evidenced solutions, Possible solutions*

[^1]: My thought was that people who do not value saving lives (or are
    in general unwilling to contribute to it or oppose policies spending
    money on foreign aid for some other reason, e.g. prejudice) exercise
    a form of motivated reasoning to justify this (perhaps in a
    nonstandard way). They choose to reason according to the
    \'proportional\' standard in order to conclude that it is not worth
    donating to these causes because \'the scope of the problem is too
    large and they will never be completely solved\'. I suggest that
    people apply this reasoning to problems specifically when they do
    not want to take action to address these problems. (In contrast, in
    domains where they do want to make a change, they may use a
    different, more marginal and \'consistent\' sort of reasoning.)
    E.g., (to be stereotypical) imagine a MAGA person who wants to end
    foreign aid because \"Africa will always have endless problems\" but
    who wants to impose restrictions on abortion (even knowing millions
    of abortions will continue to occur) because \"every unborn life
    matters.\"

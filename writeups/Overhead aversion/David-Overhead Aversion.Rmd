Description 
===========

Potential donors may have a negative feeling towards a charity's costs
that are considered "overhead" rather than "direct spending on program
activities." This may make them reluctant to donate to charities that
express a high "overhead ratio" and/or when they believe their donation
will go to "pay for overhead", and to favor instead charities that
report low "overhead ratios".

Discussion: There are some clear flaws in this logic (thus we may call
it "overhead bias"): many things considered overhead are fixed or sunk
costs which will not be changed by the amounts donated; thus, at the
*margin* the donation may not actually go towards this overhead.

Marginal overhead is also possible. Suppose, e.g., the cost of an
additional year of school tuition fees for a child are \$200, but this
requires an additional administrative cost of \$50 to vet the student
and her family, pay money transfer fees, fill out additional forms, etc.
A donation of \$200 earmarked for "tuition only" would require an
additional \$50 of these costs, which might be labled "overhead".
However, as this example suggests, many such "overhead" expenses are
necessary parts of the mission, an increase its effectiveness (e.g.,
training employees, auditing, evaluating and targeting programs). On the
other hand, we cannot rule out that in some cases high overhead might be
a signal of inefficient practices. Where organizations have bloated
annual operating expenses it might be more efficient for them to close
down in the medium term and for that money to be used for leaner
charities. (Several theoretical papers \[ref: Steinberg ?1986 and later
work\] discuss whether or not the overhead ratios are a sign of
efficiency.)

Overview of Evidence
====================

Survey and observational evidence suggests that donors focus on
potentially misleading measures of overhead. Gneezy et al (2014) present
a credible piece of field-experimental evidence suggesting that having a
"lead donor" and framing this as "covering overhead" may increase
donations. Metzger and Gunther's (2019) lab participants donate
(marginally) significantly less when presented with (the option to buy)
information about a NGO's administrative costs (perhaps because such
costs were made salient). Caviola et al's (hypothetical?) experiments
suggest that *evaluability* may drive the focus on overhead rather than
effectiveness. Portillo and Stinn's lab participants favored
overhead-free charities and preferred fundraising-related to
salary-related overhead. Kinsbergen et al's representative (Dutch)
survey participants "have a strong aversion regarding overhead costs,
\[but\]\... seem to value the capacities of paid staff members and are,
to a certain extent, willing to pay a price for these."

-   How this particular barrier proves problematic for effective giving?

Study \[ref\] finds 'no correlation' between overhead and
effectiveness\-- is it convincing?

As noted above, overhead is an important input to the charity's
production function, enabing it to be effective. A biases against
overhead therefore distort's the donor choice of charity away from
effectiveness. The other side of this coin: in an efficient market firms
provide the services consumers demand. If consumers have a preference
for firms that use a lower share of some input, this will "distort" the
production process away from this input, making it seem artificially
costly \[ref: Reinstein and Song, others\]. Similarly, if donors punish
charities for excessive overhead, charities will use "too little" of
inputs deemed to be overhead.

Note that doing impact evaluation will itself increase overhead. I.e.,
aversion to overhead will lead people to be biased against
evidence-based charities that evaluate their own programs.

While the above concerns do not necessarily tilt against charities
targeting overeas or lower-profile causes, it nonetheless represents a
departure from efficiency in choice/provision of charitable services.

Furthermore, there is a reasonable case \[todo: get evidence\] that
working in poor countries, countries that are further from the charity's
headquarters, and countries more distant from legal, financial, and
other services *will* lead to a greater overhead ratio. This may be
accentuated if the *basic* service (e.g., food, housing, or education)
is cheaper in poor countries. E.g., sending a poor child in Chicago to a
summer enrichment program might cost \$4000 in fees and \$500 to
administer the scholarship, roughly 11% "overhead share" . Sending a
poor Ghanaian child for a year might cost \$300 plus \$100 in
administration, a 25% share.

Gneezy, Uri, Elizabeth A. Keenan, and Ayelet Gneezy. "Avoiding overhead aversion in charity." Science 346.6209 (2014): 632-635.\|
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gneezy et al (2014) ran a large-scale (N=40,000 \[check\]) mail
solicitation on behalf of an organization seeking to fund as many US
educational projects (each costing \$20,000) as possible. Recipients
were asked to give \$20/50/100. They found that framing a lead donation
as "covering\[ing\] all the overhead costs associated with raising the
needed donations" lead to a significantly greater share donating and
amount raised than either the control condition (no lead donation?) or a
seed ("has given this campaign seed money") or matching frame ("will
match every dollar given... up to a total of \$10,000").[^1]

Note that while the framing differed, the *actual* treatment of the seed
money in each case was the same; unless the charity could change the way
it *administered* its programs between treatment, there is no clear way
to experimentally vary the *actual* overhead.

This amounts to a clear piece of evidence that in such contexts
*framing* overhead as being "covered" in this way may increase
donations. However, it doesn't reveal donors' reaction to the reported
measure of overhead *itself*. The effect may come from the particular
salience of the way the lead donor's (particularly selfless) act is
portrayed, or it may be specific to overhead "*associated with raising
... donations"* rather than administrative overhead, salaries, etc.

The same authors ran a *lab* experiment where they were able to vary the
share of the subjects' donation that actually went to the charity,
labeling the difference (donation - amount passed) as "overhead", and in
a second treatment arm, whether this "overhead" was covered by a third
party. The results were similar to the field experiment \[CHECK, go into
more detail\]. However, this transparent "donation reduction" has little
in common with the real-world costs usually depicted as "overhead". In
this lab experiment, a donor who cares about her marginal impact
*should* consider the pass-through rate or "price"; this is not
"overhead illusion".[^2]

Lab experiment

\"If an overhead-free donation is readily available, then the average
donor in our experiment (70--80% of subjects) prefers that charity to
receive the donation. However, if donations are not overhead-free, most
(approximately two-thirds of subjects) prefer the donation go toward
fundraising efforts instead of salary-related expenditures.\"

Hypothetical survey (vignettes, scenarios) "We constructed 960 scenarios in which a fictive \[international\] development organisation was described. ... A large representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 2,758) received six randomly allocated scenarios and had to decide if, and if so, how much they would donate to the depicted (fictive) organisation.... Although donors have a strong aversion regarding overhead costs, we find that donors seem to value the capacities of paid staff members and are, to a certain extent, willing to pay a price for these.

However, this does *not* typify the overhead we are considering. Here,
we see variation in the donot's *actual* costs of providing outputs; as
in Gneezy et al's lab experiments, this is not "illusion". While donor
responses to e.g., greater fixed costs of maintaining an office in
Malawi, or greater costs of identifying legitimately poor families
*might* be similar, we do not know.[^4]

Hope Consulting Survey:

"a recent survey found that only 35 percent of donors do any research
before giving (Hope Consulting, 2012), this is a valid concern -- though
among those who did research, the most commonly sought information was
some type of overhead ratio, and two-thirds were seeking some sort of
information related to efficiency."-Meer

**"**We thus clarified that a decrease in administrative costs from 40%
to 10% is equivalent to a 50% increase in net transfers to the
recipient, in an attempt to make the administration costs group as
comparable to the aid impact group as possible." \-- this oversimplified
framing may be driving their results.

"A. a relatively small share of people makes a well-informed donation
decision. B. the demand for information about aid impact is lowest, and
it is highest for information about the recipient type. C. impact info
didn\'t affect average donation, while information about the exact
recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in
donation levels."

"In the recipient type group, informed participants donated
significantly more than uninformed participants because they "rewarded"
the preferred recipient with higher-than- average transfers. In the
administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly
less than uninformed participants because they used the information to
"punish" NGOs with high administration costs."

"only 28% of the participants in the bought ANY information (impact, who
benefits overhead). Within that, highest demand for beneficiary, lowest
for impact. Impact info no effect on giving. Knowing who benefits info
increased giving. Overhead info decreased giving."

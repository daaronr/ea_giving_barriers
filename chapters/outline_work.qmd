# Evidence, empirical considerations, organization {#evidence}

## Structure of each 'barriers' section {#structure-barriers}

**In each 'barriers' section we consider...**

1. **A category of barriers**; this is a first-level heading, e.g. '[Quantitative biases](#quant-biases)' is section \@ref(quant-biases).

Here we discuss this category in general, explaining its meaning and plausibility in terms of the underlying theories, models, and generalized observations.

2. **Each specific barrier in this category** gets a second-level heading, e.g., ["Proportional dominance effect"](#prop-dom) is section \@ref(prop-dom).


3. For each specific barrier we first present (third-level headings):

-   **Definition** of the barrier
-   **Conceptual explanation of the barrier**, relating this to theory and generalized observation
-   **Relevance to effective giving** (sometimes recapping what was stated above)

\
4. Next we consider the **Evidence**, with a third-level header preamble discussing the nature of the evidence.

5. Within this, we consider the **evidence for each specific empirical claim** supporting the case for this barrier's existence and importance.

::: {.alert .alert-secondary}
 

We hope to:

- 'operationalize' each claim with a falsifiable set of predictions
   - justifying the connection to each prediction,

- and carefully asses the strength of the evidence for each of these claims.

See, e.g., our work-in-progress on 'CBA avoidance' [here](#cba-evidence).

This distinguishes the current project from broader reviews and literature surveys.

 
:::

\

In considering the evidence for these claims, we generally consider one paper or project at a time (or a specific piece of independent evidence from this paper).^[ However, we are still considering the best narrative approach to presenting evidence from multiple papers/projects/analyses.
]

## Consideration of each paper {#paper-structure}

For each paper we focus on key elements, including:

-   **Method** (lab experiment involving real charitable asks, natural field experiment with charity partner, observational analysis asserting causality via a regression discontinuity approach, etc.)

-   The **context** and data (the population of donors or lab participants, the charity(s) involved, etc.)

-   The **nature of the 'treatment'** or independent variable (e.g., realistic information presented about impact per dollar)

-   The **strength and credibility of the empirical results** (considering, e.g., limitations and confounds in the design, experimenter-demand effects, estimates' statistical strength and power, appropriateness of the statistical analysis, preregistration, signs of specification-fishing and multiple-testing without corrections, replications and citations, etc.)

- Link where to find the paper itself as well as the materials and the data collected.\

::: {.alert .alert-secondary}
 
For example, within the category **[Barriers: Aversion/obstacles to *doing* (using) evaluations; effect of analytical information on generosity](#eval-aversion)** ...

we consider the barrier ["General cost-benefit analysis (CBA)-aversion or reluctance"](#cba-aversion)...

weighing evidence  specific claims such as ["People sometimes actively avoid information about charity effectiveness that would motivate doing a CBA..."](-#avoid_info_CBA)...


coming from research papers/studies such as  @fongTruthGivingExperimental2010.

## Evidence and meta-analysis: discussion {#evidence0meta}


We consider^[Further discussion needed here
]


1. The nature of evidence for drivers of effective/ineffective giving, and how we might evaluate it

2. Meta analysis: Existing work and plans for doing meta-analysis as part of this project

See [innovationsinfundraising](https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=tools:meta-analysis_approach#references_and_discussion_of_specific_issues_in_meta-analysis) for some earlier discussion of this, as well as ["What works to increase charitable donations? A meta-review with meta-meta-analysis" by Noetel et al](https://psyarxiv.com/yxmva/)



## Airtable organisation; contributing content {#airtable-contrib}

**These classifications of barriers** are organised, outlined, and defined in our Airtable; see the view below.

**The barriers themselves** are organised as well, see the view below:

## Other practical considerations, partnerships


This project is informally connected with the [EA Market Testing team](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/). However, this project is several years older, and the scope is not entirely overlapping. The present project focuses on giving, while EAMT has a broader agenda connected with the EA movement. The EAMT is mainly a practically-driven project, while the current synthesis also considers braoder and more theoretical issues.

# (Persistent and systematic incorrect empirical beliefs) {#factual}

**Connection to terms/concepts in other work**

@caviola2020many (literature review) considers ["Epistemic Obstacles"](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(21)00090-5#secst0060); this is one of their 2 'barriers' sections, the other being 'Motivational obstacles'. In that section, they consider some of the 'misconceptions' stated below, as well as  the 'overhead myth' (cf our ['overhead aversion'](#overhead-aversion)) and 'quantifiability skepticism', 'innumeracy', and 'ignorance about the most effective charities'

```

Recapping the discussion from the [Conceptual breakdown of 'barriers'](#barriers-concept).

There is abundant evidence that people are misinformed (or at least *state* incorrect beliefs) about the true state of the world, in systematic ways, And that misconceptions persist over time. Some of these misconceptions may prove particularly pernicious to effective charitable giving; others may simply lead to "departure from optimization" in giving choices.

We considered whether to present these as 'fundamental barriers', rather than the results of other fundamental biases and norms. For example:

-   People may make statements about the effectiveness of humanitarian aid and charity that are clearly too pessimistic. However, these statements may come from a desire to *justify* one's lack of support for this, rather than being a deeply-held belief. (ref: that 'Elephant in the Brain' discussion)

-   Limited knowledge about the welfare/suffering/poverty of people and animals, and about long-term existential risks may result from [*distance*](#aware-distance): physical, experiential, cultural, etc.

-   Common [quantitative biases](#quant-biases) may foster and enhance these misconceptions

Fundamentally there are systematic reasons why we might *not* expect 'incorrect beliefs that are relevant to charitable donation choices' to be corrected. The incentives and the information-feedback is not clearly present. Charitable giving is a *credence* good for the donor. Charitable organizations may often raise more money by *not* correcting these misconceptions, and even by enhancing them.\

## Some key misconceptions; evidence these may have an effect

-   Differences in effectiveness across charities (understated; see, e.g., @caviolaDonorsVastlyUnderestimate2020)

-   Cost of saving a life (understated, i.e., overoptimistic)

-   Relative global affluence (understated): @nairMisperceptionsRelativeAffluence2018

(@caviola2020many also suggest 'ignorance about the most effective charities')

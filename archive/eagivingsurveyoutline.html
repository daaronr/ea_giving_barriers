<p>%Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next</p>
<p>Reinstein, Fitz, Kagan</p>
<h1 id="presenting-the-puzzle-and-challenge-our-ineffective-giving">1. Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving</h1>
<p>Why should you care about this? Descriptives of giving (US, international) and how 'ineffective' it is. Potential global welfare gains to changing 'where we give'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideas42: &quot;We did not find many field-based, experimental studies on the factors that encourage people to choose thoughtfully among charities or to plan ahead to give. &quot;</p>

<h2 id="a.-who-does-give-effectively-or-put-at-bottom">1a. Who does give effectively? (or put at bottom?)</h2>
<p>Who <em>does</em> give internationally/effectively (descriptives). Briefly defining the EA movement as an important force &quot;we&quot; (economists, psychologists) need to discuss. (Or put this at bottom?)</p>
<p>Fitz/Kagan: Understanding Effective Givers: In this study we attempt to understand who is predisposed towards effective giving. After providing a description of the effective giving movement, we measure support for effective giving and measure a wide range of personality traits and demographics that may predict support for effective giving.</p>
<h2 id="b.-why-under-what-models-is-this-a-puzzle">1b. Why (under what models) is this a puzzle?</h2>
<p>Why (under what models) is this a puzzle? Economics and psych models --&gt; puzzle? Models where people care about the impact of their gift or just 'amount sacrificed' (naive warm glow). Does impact map into the 'good feeling' from giving, can it do so?</p>
<h2 id="c-are-charities-in-competition-is-the-ineffective-giving-reducing-effective-giving-ask-people-to-give-to-ea-charity-instead">1c: Are charities in competition? Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? Ask people to give to EA charity 'instead'?</h2>
<p>(Or put in section 2?)</p>
<p>Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another... when and how? This is critical to understanding the extent to which gains can be achieved by getting people to 'switch' from other charities. To the extent this is the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressure you to give to local orgs) themselves represent barriers to EA giving (see below).</p>
<p>(David Reinstein has a simultaneous research project on this 'expenditure substitution' question.)</p>

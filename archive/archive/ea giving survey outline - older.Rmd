1. Presenting the puzzle and challenge: Our ineffective giving
==============================================================

**(Motivation)** Why should you care about this? Descriptives of giving
(US, international) and how \'ineffective\' it is. Potential global
welfare gains to changing "where we give."

Bekkers

**RQ/Problem: Why don't people give in an evidence-based way?** (what
are the psychological motivations for not giving effectively?). People
make evidence-based decisions when they invest/buy, but not when they
give (why?). People say they want to give effectively (Money for Good)
\-- Intention/Action \-- people say they want to do good and be
effective, but they don't actually \-- why?

**Motivation**

"The Science of Giving" (2011), introduction: contrasts Tsunami,
Pakistan earthquake, Sept-11. "A startling level of inconsistency in the
way donations are raised and allocated to needy recipients... mirrored
by biases in bedia attention. (Armstrong ea '06, Eisensee & S '07,
Slovic '07)"

Simple analysis finds low correlation to Charity Navigator efficiency
rating... "So, if people's donations aren't governed by the amount of
the need or the quality of the organizations, what are the factors that
govern charitable giving?"

Other relevant examples of literature reviews/surveys/meta:

1a. Who does give effectively? (or put at bottom?)
--------------------------------------------------

Who *does* give internationally/effectively (descriptives). Briefly
defining the EA movement as an important force \"we\" (economists,
psychologists) need to discuss. (Or put this at bottom?)

Fitz/Kagan: Understanding Effective Givers: In this study we attempt to
understand who is predisposed towards effective giving. After providing
a description of the effective giving movement, we measure support for
effective giving and measure a wide range of personality traits and
demographics that may predict support for effective giving.

1b. Why (under what models) is this a puzzle?
---------------------------------------------

Why (under what models) is this a puzzle? Economics and psych models →
puzzle? Models where people care about the impact of their gift or just
\'amount sacrificed\' (naive warm glow). Does impact map into the \'good
feeling\' from giving, can it do so?

1c: Are charities in competition? Is the ineffective giving reducing effective giving? Ask people to give to EA charity \'instead\'?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Or put in section 2?)

Does one ask (or donation) crowd out another\... when and how? This is
critical to understanding the extent to which gains can be achieved by
getting people to \'switch\' from other charities. To the extent this is
the case, factors driving giving to the non-EA charities, especially
local obligations (e.g., neighbors pressure you to give to local orgs)
themselves represent barriers to EA giving (see below).

(David Reinstein has a simultaneous research project on this
\'expenditure substitution\' question.)

2.  2. Explaining the puzzle: Barriers to EA giving and potential responses, evidence
    =================================================================================

    1.  2a. Economic and psych models conceptualizing this
        --------------------------------------------------

        2a: Do people care about impact? \"Efficiency\" versus impact.
        --------------------------------------------------------------

Charity \'quality ratings\' -, Overhead aversion

Andrioni 'warm glow'

3.  ( or here \-- 2a: Charities in competition? Ask people to give to EA charity \'instead\'?)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2b. Barriers: Biases in perceiving impact (or in perceiving the importance of impact)[^1]
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cognitive biases: Overweighting and underweighting probabilities
(relates to *availability bias*)[^2], misunderstanding marginality (vs
average, pakistan vs tsunami; also relates to drop in the bcket and
futility), scope-insensitivity,[^3] Opportunity-cost neglect.,
confirmation bias, , identifiable victims effect (put elsewhere?)

Responses: De-biasing, etc.

kogut\_2005b, Kinsbergen\_tolsma\_13

2b. Barriers: Presenting analytical/impact information switches off system 1;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charity effectiveness (info/deliberation) -, Donor\'s mood (Impacting) -
Affect prime -, Evaluation mode -

(Karlan & W, \'07), (Kogut & R, \'05) (Small ea, \'07), (Drouvelis & G,
\'16), (Caviola ea, \'14)

We next survey the empirical work related to whether (and when and how)
presenting information on a charity\'s impact (amount of good done per
dollar spent) will have a positive effect on amounts raised, and
donation propensity. The evidence (from the Economics/Behavioral
Economics literature) is largely mixed and indeterminate. There has been
only a single strong field trial (Karlan) in a particular context, which
itself reported mixed (null overall, positive for some subgroups,
negative for others), and some underpowered results. Laboratory
experiments (with real donations) by Small et al find that giving to an
identifiable victim is *reduced* when statistics are also presented and
"priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim
relative to a feeling-based thinking prime." Further evidence from lab
experiments is mixed and limited, with some studies (Fong and O)
*apparently* finding that exogenous information about recipient
increases donations (although they do not report this), and another
underpowered study (Metzger and G). There is some evidence from
observational studies that \'charity ratings\' boost giving, at least
for smaller charities (Yoruk), but these ratings do not measure impact.
Further review should explore the psychology (see., e.g., Verkaik),
marketing, and nonprofit management literatures. There is some
speculation, but again, mixed evidence, that individuals already in a
"system 2" (deliberative) frame are more likely to be positively
affected by impact information. There is also a distinction to be
further explored between "output information" (how the donation is used)
and "impact information"; the former is seen to increase generosity in
several studies.

2b. Barriers: Avoiding information, motivated reasoning in processing it
------------------------------------------------------------------------

andreoni2017avoiding, Exley2016, Exley2015, dellavigna2012
Kellner\_EA\_2017,

2b. Barriers: Perfectionism/deontological aversion to \'waste\' (or excuse-driven, motivated reasoning), lack of tangibility (giving to a diffuse cause); Percieved lack of transparency, and perceived corruption overseas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\"Overhead aversion, Information about recipients\' deservingness -,
\"Avoid uncertainties/excuses not to give/mental transactions costs - \"

(Gneezy ea, \'14), (Fong & O, \'10), (Exley, \'16b) (Andreoni ea, \'17),
(Dellavigna ea, \'12)

2b. Barriers: Social/geographic distance attenuates empathy (and other motivators)[^4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Info enhancing) social closeness of recipient -

?cuddy\_ea\_2007 (Sudhir ea, \'16)

2b. Barriers: Strong local appeals (\'the ask\'), social obligations to give locally, and need for "virtue-signaling" (and \'crowding out\'/moral licensing may exist)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  3. Tools for motivating EA giving
    =================================

    1.  3a. Psych/behavioral tools; applicability to EA charities
        ---------------------------------------------------------

Briefly highlight those \'tools\' that give non-EA an advantage, but
focus on the actionable\--how EA lessen or flip that advantage. 2. Which
tools present particular challenges or opportunities for EA

Recipient\'s plight as \'loss\' vs previous state -, Unconditional gift
(Gift exchange) -, \"Percentage donations tied to purchases, especially
in online auctions -\", Give more tomorrow -, Give if you win -, \"Size
of ask; Low-ball, \'Legitimation of paltry donation\' (LPD/LPC) -\",
Solicitor characteristics -, Visibility (of giver), Visibility -
Recognition \'to influence others\', Visibility - Recognition tiers,
Reveal previous donor/donation (also \'info\') -

3d. EA-movement approaches and pitfalls
---------------------------------------

What has EA tried and how has it worked; evaluate approaches in light of
the evidence. Is the movement too \'purist\' (e.g., focusing on only the
most effective, proven charities instead of those with broader potential
appeal but less evidence)?

4. Conclusion; a research agenda
================================

Need for systematic platforms to study this, systematic experimentation
and data sharing among effective/international charities. Platforms
available, proposals for particular research projects and approaches.

-   Who gives to the *truly* most effective international charities?

-   Who is most likely to be convinced, and which
    > arguments/presentations work in the SR and LR, and for whom
    > (heterogeneity)?

    -   Statistical learning-based analyses

-   Practicable techniques in a range of higher-stakes real-world
    > environments

-   Replication (and verification), pooled evidence, meta-analysis

    -   Context-sensitivity, large SE $\rightarrow$ large samples,
        > statistical learning controls, sharing data

    -   Responses to \'obvious contrasts\' seem to not reflect
        > between-subject responses\"

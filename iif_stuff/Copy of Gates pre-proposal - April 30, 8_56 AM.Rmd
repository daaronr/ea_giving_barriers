-   *Summary for Gates foundation, draft composed by David Reinstein;
    > survey paper is with Nick Fitz and Ari Kagan*

**[Purpose and proposed outputs]{.underline}:** Our research,
communication, and impact program aims to provide practical methods to
increase the level and impact of *informed and intentional generosity*.
We are building a database of evidence on *what works*, with a
particular focus on impact-driven donation behavior. We will assess,
evaluate, and present this in several ways, including an interactive
database, a collaborative wiki, and a meta-analysis survey paper. Each
of these will be carefully linked and integrated. For example, the
analysis and discussion in the survey paper will be mirrored in the
structure of the wiki, providing a platform for discussion and updating.
Each element of the surveyed evidence will be provided as a database
entry, cross-referencing relevant papers, theories, use-cases, and
available raw data. This *living resource* will be able to quickly
compile and disseminate the best available evidence to users. The
meta-analysis will be presented in the database and wiki, as well as in
a web app (e.g., R Shiny Rstudio). This will permit users to consider
alternate assumptions and methodological criteria, and to focus on
particular domains as relevant to their own practice. We aim to engage a
diverse user-base, including fundraisers, charities, academics, and
donors/philanthropists. Thus we will offer multiple formats (while
avoiding confusing overlap), allowing users to choose their preferred
level of technicality and detail.

*Partial and preliminary work can be found on the* [[Innovations in
Fundraising
wiki]{.underline}](http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:evidence_tools);
further work is compiled in a database format (Airtable).

1.  Key questions
    -------------

    1.  *Targeting and basic approach*

-   Who gives to effective charities, and can we predict who is likely
    > to be convinced to do so? How can we best target and persuade the
    > general population as well as high-Å„et-worth individuals?

-   Is it productive to ask people to *shift* their giving towards more
    > impactful charities? If so, when and how is this effective?
    > Underlying this: are charities in competition and do people "rob
    > Peter to pay Paul?"

*Psychology*

-   Individual barriers to moving toward more effective giving may
    > include cognitive dissonance avoidance, cost-benefit aversion, and
    > opportunity-cost neglect; as well as common factual misconceptions
    > about international charities. Will de-biasing and correcting
    > misconceptions lead to more effective giving?

-   How can we present effectiveness information in a way that *works*,
    > without dampening emotional motivations to give? Can we avoid
    > self-interested "motivated reasoning" responses to this?

-   How can we reduce the *empathic distance* to international
    > recipients and make those geographically-distant feel local?

-   How can we best apply standard emotional and behavioral approaches
    > (evidence-based fundraising tools like \"gift exchange\") to
    > *effective* charities. In applying these tools, what superpowers
    > and weaknesses do the most effective charities have?

-   How can we incorporate psychological and social *rewards for donors*
    > without overly sacrificing efficiency? What is the tradeoff
    > between promoting the purest, best-evidenced charities (e.g.,
    > GiveWell\'s list) and increasing the overall donation amounts?

*Policy*

-   \- Will the tools that boost effective giving also increase support
    > for foreign aid and pro-poor policies?

-   \- What is the interaction between private giving, the level of
    > public funding for effective causes, and support for government
    > policies, and how can we boost the *net* public and private
    > impact?

-   1.  A program for future work and evaluating previous work

-   [Build platforms]{.underline} to observe relevant giving behavior
    > and run experiments to understand the impact of approaches across
    > several contexts.

-   [Open Science Framework]{.underline}: Maintain research integrity,
    > collaboration and data-sharing, enabling re-analysis and
    > meta-analysis.

-   [Robust and validated evidence]{.underline}: This includes
    > pre-registration and pre-analysis plans, experimentation and
    > independent replication across a range of relevant environment and
    > frames.

-   [Present research for *users* in an effective way, using modern
    > information systems]{.underline}. Avoid "old-school" academic
    > journal presentation formats and "frozen PDFs" in favor of living,
    > continually-validated and re-assessed content. Open access in a
    > web framework.

-   [Collaboration]{.underline} with and among relevant
    > charities/fundraisers (e.g., International Fundraising Leadership
    > Forum)

-   Use wiki and other collaboration tools to organize open
    > communication and sharing

    -   of research results and insights, data, and methods,

    -   of informal (non-academic, non-systematic) trials and
        > experiences, and

-   of critical insider knowledge and intuition.

User stories: Who will use this and how?
========================================

1.  [Effective charities, their fundraisers, and groups of these
    > organizations]{.underline} (e.g., the
    > [[IFCL]{.underline}](http://www.fundraisers.fr/sites/default/files/4/IFL-Forum-presentation-at-IFC-2014_0.pdf))
    > will use this directly to increase their support-base, their
    > appeal, and their income. Evidence will be presented in
    > interactive and accessible ways, including more and less technical
    > presentations, allowing users to select a tailored analysis. We
    > will provide personal support to qualified effective charities.

2.  [Government policymakers]{.underline}: in enabling and enhancing
    > effective private giving, and providing public programs that are
    > compatible with this.

3.  [Foundations]{.underline}: in targeting and communicating
    > interventions, considering interactions and feedback on the wider
    > society of givers

4.  [Advocates and activists]{.underline} for globally sympathetic and
    > pro-poor policies; as research is likely to unlock both factors
    > that encourage effective giving and factors that drive
    > cross-cultural sympathy, empathy, and action

5.  [Academic, professional, and applied researchers]{.underline}

    > directly, and as an input into understanding human behavior). *Our

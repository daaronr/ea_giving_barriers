## Non-technical abstract {-#pop-abstract} 

Hunger, homelessness, mental and physical illness, environmental degradation: the needs are boundless, but the resources to solve these problems are limited. Even with the best of intentions and impressive generosity ([Americans give roughly 2% of their income to charity](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/The-Stubborn-2-Giving-Rate/154691#:~:text=Americans%20gave%20%24316.2%2Dbillion%20to,the%20same%20as%20in%202011.)), donors often contribute to inefficient charities -- ones that spend more but accomplish less than others that may be competing for the same funds. Each dollar given to the most effective charities (like those rated by [Givewell.org](http://givewell.org)) benefits greater numbers of people in more significant ways than the least effective ones. However, donors do not always consider "Effective Altruism" (EA) when deciding how much to give and to which organizations.

Academics (in Economics, Psychology, Biology, and Philosophy) have applied a range of theories to explain what drives "inefficient altruism." Evidence comes from a variety of studies, involving surveys, observational work, laboratory experiments, and, where feasible, natural field experiments. These have not been run as part of a systematic project addressing this issue; goals, contexts, and approaches have varied as opportunities presented. Given the disparate findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors impact effective giving.

abstract = {This study investigated possible mediators of the identifiable victim effect (IVE), the proportion dominance effect (PDE), and the in-group effect (IGE) in helping situations. In Studies 1-3, participants rated their emotional reactions (distress and sympathy toward the victims), perceived impact of helping, perceived responsibility to help, and helping motivation toward four versions of a helping situation. Gradually increasing victim identifiability in the helping situations primarily affected emotional reactions and sympathy completely mediated the IVE. Gradually making the reference-group smaller primarily affected perceived impact, and impact completely mediated the PDE. Gradually increasing in-groupness primarily affected perceived responsibility, and responsibility completely mediated the IGE. Study 4 included real monetary allocations and largely replicated the results using a between-subject design. Together, the results shed light on how contextual factors trigger help motivation, and indicate that different helping effects are primarily mediated by different mechanisms.},

@article{Friedrich1999,
abstract = {Costly life-saving interventions can often be described not only in terms ofthe num-ber of lives that may be saved but also in terms of the proportion of lives saved out of some total number at risk. In a phenomenon that has been referred to as psychophysical numbing (PN), Fetherstonhaugh, Slovic, Johnson, and Friedrich (1997) found that participants rated an intervention saving a fixed number of lives to be less worth investing in when more total lives were at risk (i,e,, when saved lives represented a smaller proportion of the total threat or problem). In two new experi-ments, life-valuation correlates of PN responding, as well as manipulations of death salience, accountability, and economics focus, were explored in the context of stu-dents' willingness to support mandatory antilock brake requirements for new cars, PN responding was pervasive, but non-PN responders were clearly distinguished by the greater overall value they placed on saving lives. Salience and accountability manipu-lations did not debias judgments but did tend to rule out low-effort processing as an explanation for these quantity confusions. An emphasis on economic considerations was consistently related to greater PN responding. As participants in a larger social system, each of us is routinely called on to make judgments concerning the appropriateness of mandating risk-reducing and life-saving interventions. Many decisions of this type (e,g,, requiring costly auto safety features to prevent some number of injuries or deaths) have substantial con-sp,quences for consumers. How do we make such decisions? The dynamics influ-encing our choices are no doubt a complicated interplay of attitudes and ideology Requests for reprints should be sent to},

abstract = {We survey 1050 consumers who have just redeemed one or more open loop gift certificates to learn whether they view gift certificate income, cash gifts and non-gift income as substitutes. We find that the majority (83{\%}) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17{\%}) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80{\%} of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30{\%} when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources.},

Despite this, the optimal design of communication strategies has received less formal attention. For their part, economists have recently explored how communication affects empathy, altruism, and giving rates to charities. Our study takes a step back from this literature to examine how suggestions-a direct ask for a certain amount of money-affect giving rates. We find that our suggestion amounts affect both the intensive and extensive margins: more people give and they tend to give the suggested amount. The resulting insights help us understand why people give, why messages work, and deepen practitioners' understanding of how to use messages to leverage more giving.},

abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as -FT- and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.},

abstract = {A person's willingness to sacrifice for others is highly sensitive
to informational conditions,

but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish
between three leading

explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous
work has not adequately

distinguished. 1) Social-signaling holds that a person wants others
to think of her as fair-

minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself
that way, and 3) beliefs-based

altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person
feel. I present a model

in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer,
which can correspond to each

of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations
using the model's predictions

about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either
by the dictator's choice

or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's
choice lowers the frequency

of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based
altruism. However, I

find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about
how he was treated by a

third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism,
and revealing partial

information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant
the recipient's information

about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving,
suggesting social-signaling.

Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing
the likelihood that it

will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the
beliefs of the recipient are

held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests
that the act of giving is

largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed
to the self, or how it makes

the recipient feel.},

abstract = {Some social institutions reveal participants' behavior in the aggregate, while concealing the identities of the participants. For example, individual church donations may be kept anonymous, while the total amount raised is publicized. This presents a puzzle in light of recent evidence that anonymity reduces contributions. We offer an explanation for this puzzle in the context of a model of costly signaling with two types of agents: conditionally cooperative (" good" ) and uncooperative (" bad" ). We consider costly participation in a community activity (e.g., tithing) as a signal of an individual's type. By signaling the presence of one more good type, this may lead other good types to contribute more in future, more important, collective goods problems (CGP's). Thus, if good types also value others' contributions more than bad types, good types gain more from sending the signal. But if those who do not signal face exclusion, the signal would need to be made very costly to dissuade bad types from signaling. In contrast, if the institution is anonymous, so that it reveals only the total number of signals, then while signals cannot be used to exclude bad types, even an inexpensive signal may succeed in revealing the total number of good types. This informationhelps good types maximize the conditional cooperation component of their utility in the CGP, and under specified conditions, can increase expected CGP contributions.

@article{Andreoni2004,
abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality
of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences
of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter
the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social
effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating
to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency.
We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and
controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying
subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two
supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices
actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior.


6. Conclusion


This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality
affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically
alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions.
By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like
pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity
and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising
institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To
get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two
additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving
anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This
allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices
may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more
detail.


We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing
only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the
givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but
not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing
donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each
is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends
to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification
tends to increase contributions.


Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set
a -good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period.
We found that the announcement structure has an important effect
on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly,
leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their
contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison
suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to
increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders,
we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in
the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when
information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily
identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to
decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal
with laggards is to make their actions and identities known.


Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising
practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to
remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having
the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their
highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people
the option to report their contributions results in more giving than
required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering
people with the choice to announce their contributions-even though
it is a -false' choice that no one would reject-might actually focus
them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that
indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects
in designing this feature of the giving institution.


Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly
shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh,
1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving.
People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category,
and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results
suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has
the potential to significantly increase contributions.


The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions
for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects
that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent,
out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising
institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote
efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by
shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences,
social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of
them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting
the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical
model of fund-raising practices. s},

@article{Caviola2014,
abstract = {We describe the -evaluability bias-: the tendency to weight the importance of an attribute in proportion to its ease of evaluation. We propose that the evaluability bias influences decision making in the context of charitable giving: people tend to have a strong preference for charities with low overhead ratios (lower administrative expenses) but not for charities with high cost-effectiveness (greater number of saved lives per dollar), because the former attribute is easier to evaluate than the latter. In line with this hypothesis, we report the results of four studies showing that, when presented with a single charity, people are willing to donate more to a charity with low overhead ratio, regardless of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with two charities simultaneously-thereby enabling comparative evaluation-they base their donation behavior on cost-effectiveness (Study 1). This suggests that people primarily value cost-effectiveness but manifest the evaluability bias in cases where they find it difficult to evaluate. However, people seem also to value a low overhead ratio for its own sake (Study 2). The evaluability bias effect applies to charities of different domains (Study 3). We also show that overhead ratio is easier to evaluate when its presentation format is a ratio, suggesting an inherent reference point that allows meaningful interpretation (Study 4).},

The solicitor controlled for order effects by varying the sequence of these three variables within each experimental group. Main effects were found for Rae, Causal Locus of Need, and Expressed Reason for Giving: Whites contributed more than blacks, the external locus of need condition produced more giving than the internal condition, and persons who heard the -feel good- reason donated more than those in the -social responsibility- condition. Additionally, a significant Causal Locus of Need - Expressed Reason for Giving interaction was found. The combination of external locus of need and -feel good- was considerably more productive of contributions than the other three combinations.

Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking."},

This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on religious participation using a newly available individual-level panel data. Understanding these spillover effects may be quite important, given the existing literature that links religiosity to several economically important social behaviors. The results show that religious giving and participation are complements. Increasing the price of religious giving decreases not only religious contributions but also religious attendance. The implied cross-price elasticity of religious participation with respect to the after-tax price of giving is -0.27. Furthermore, a 1{\%} increase in the amount of religious contributions is associated with a 0.4{\%} increase in religious attendance. These results are robust under several different specifications and highlight the positive externalities created by charitable subsidies. They also have important implications for testing the validity of existing economic models of religious participation and giving.},

abstract = {This article develops a new model of altruism called impact philanthropy. An impact philanthropist is someone who wants to personally -make a difference.' While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

@article{Lishner2015,
abstract = {Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommen-dations propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop a concise and concrete list of core research dependability recommendations that address problems of false positive and false negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the current research dependability literature and earlier literatures dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth seeking mindset during the research endeavor. A recent confluence of factors, including high-profile cases of research fraud by psychologists, questions regarding the depend-ability and replicability of scientific results, and concerns about the use of questionable research practices, has contributed to the emergence of a new movement to improve the scientific integrity of psychological science (Asendorpf et al., 2013; Funder et al., The primary goals of this movement, which I will refer to as the research dependability movement, are to illuminate problems in contempo-rary psychological science that undermine the integrity of empir-ical findings and to present potential solutions for how to address these problems. The movement appears to be gaining momentum as indicated by changes in the editorial policies of various prom-inent journals that appear designed to promote greater dependabil-ity in published findings (for several examples, see editorial pol-icies at Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Research in Personality, and Psychological Science). Increasing support for the movement has spawned numerous commentaries that seek to address the dependability problem (e.g., Ledgerwood, 2014a, 2014b, and accompanying special section articles; Makel, 2014, and accompanying special section articles; Pashler {\&} Wangenmakers, 2012, and accompanying special section articles; Spellman, 2012, and accompanying special section articles). Although several attempts to integrate solutions into comprehensive lists have been attempted (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013; Cumming, 2014; Funder et al., 2014), the number of proposed solutions and recommendations is growing quite large. A sampling of such recommendations based on a casual reading of various research dependability commentaries is provided in Table 1. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations for improving re-search dependability has created several problems. First, the high number of recommendations is overwhelming for those hoping to implement meaningful changes in their own research activities or training programs. Second, the high number of recommendations makes it challenging to coordinate meaningful responses within and across constituencies that make up psychological science (i.e., researchers, journal editors and reviewers, administrators of re-search support institutions, and educators). Together, these prob-lems are fairly obvious in their potential impact: too many recom-mendations make it difficult to address research dependability challenges in a manner that is uniform among individuals within and across different constituencies. However, a third less obvious problem exists with the numerous research dependability recommendations. Specifically, many are based on concerns that arise from two earlier movements in psychological methodology and statistics that rest on somewhat contradictory assumptions. When these recommendations are un-critically blended under the research dependability umbrella, they may promote conflicting behaviors that undermine the very goals the dependability movement seeks to achieve. Given these problems, the purpose of the present commentary is to arrive at a concise list of core recommendations to improve the integrity of psychological science. This process was based on three guiding principles. First, and most importantly, core recommen-dations should be internally consistent in that they should lead to nonconflicting outcomes in addressing research dependability is-sues. Second, the number of recommendations should be small and},

We employ an experimental design with three treatments that vary the recipient (experimenter, charity) and amount passed (fixed, varying). We find giving to the experimenter not to be significantly different from giving to a charity, when the amount the subject donates crowds out the amount donated by the experimenter such that the charity always receives a fixed amount. This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.},

Gradually increasing victim identifiability in the helping situations primarily affected emotional reactions and sympathy completely mediated the IVE. Gradually making the reference-group smaller primarily affected perceived impact, and impact completely mediated the PDE. Gradually increasing in-groupness primarily affected perceived responsibility, and responsibility completely mediated the IGE. Study 4 included real monetary allocations and largely replicated the results using a between-subject design. Together, the results shed light on how contextual factors trigger help motivation, and indicate that different helping effects are primarily mediated by different mechanisms.},

At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Development Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations. The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order. The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time before they reach the end of their lists. These observations suggest a simple strategy for testing whether personal solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the beginning, ceteris paribus. If so, then a marginal personal solicitation matters. Our main finding is that the location in the alphabet - and hence, a marginal personal solicitation - has a strong effect on the probability of making a gift. A rough estimate of the elasticity of the probability of giving with respect to the probability of receiving a personal solicitation is 0.15. However, there is no statistically discernible effect on the amount given, conditional on donating. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

One would therefore expect that charitable organizations could benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising if they were able to persuade donors to do so for them. However, little is known on the costs and benefits of asking donors to fundraise. We investigate this by implementing a field experiment embedded in an online giving organization's web page. In our experiment, donors who have completed an online transaction were randomly asked to share having donated by posting on their Facebook (FB) wall or by sending a private message to a friend on FB. To further explore the impact of incentives on the willingness to fundraise, donors were also assigned to one of three treatments in which the organization added either {\$}0, {\$}1 or {\$}5 in the donor's name in exchange for sharing the information. We have several findings: (1) Donors respond to incentives: larger add-on donations increase the willingness to post having made a donation. (2) Nuisance costs may be important: willingness to post is over two times higher among those already logged into FB. (3) The type of ask matters: willingness to post via one's wall or via a private message is different. (4) There are benefits to incentivizing peer-to-peer fundraising in increased new donations.},

abstract = {In a door-to-door fundraising field experiment, we study the impact of fundraising mechanisms on charitable giving. We approached about 4500 households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute.},

abstract = {When the government gives a gr ant to a private charitable organization, do the donors to that organization give less? If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75{\%}. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30{\%} to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70{\%} to over 100{\%} of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact
philanthropist's charitable

fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists
can reduce aggregate giving. In

addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship
between givers and receivers in

which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict
between charitable

organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable
gifts. In particular, a charitable

organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many
goods, whereas a donor prefers to

target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many
econometric applications have neglected an important implication
of it: the standard practice of interpreting the parameters of log-linearized
models estimated by ordinary least squares as elasticities can be
highly misleading in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This paper
explains why this problem arises and proposes an appropriate estimator.
Our criticism of conventional practices and the solution we propose
extends to a broad range of economic applications where the equation
under study is log-linearized. We develop the argument using one
particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade, and apply
the proposed technique to provide new estimates of this equation.
We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the
proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

abstract = {We describe the -evaluability bias-: the tendency to weight the importance of an attribute in proportion to its ease of evaluation. We propose that the evaluability bias influences decision making in the context of charitable giving: people tend to have a strong preference for charities with low overhead ratios (lower administrative expenses) but not for charities with high cost-effectiveness (greater number of saved lives per dollar), because the former attribute is easier to evaluate than the latter. In line with this hypothesis, we report the results of four studies showing that, when presented with a single charity, people are willing to donate more to a charity with low overhead ratio, regardless of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with two charities simultaneously-thereby enabling comparative evaluation-they base their donation behavior on cost-effectiveness (Study 1). This suggests that people primarily value cost-effectiveness but manifest the evaluability bias in cases where they find it difficult to evaluate. However, people seem also to value a low overhead ratio for its own sake (Study 2). The evaluability bias effect applies to charities of different domains (Study 3). We also show that overhead ratio is easier to evaluate when its presentation format is a ratio, suggesting an inherent reference point that allows meaningful interpretation (Study 4).},

In Study 1, an experiment using real charitable appeals, giving more
money to charity led to higher levels of happiness only when participants
gave to causes that explained how these funds are used to make a
difference in the life of a recipient. In Study 2, participants were
asked to reflect upon a time they spent money on themselves or on
others in a way that either had a positive impact or had no impact.
Participants who recalled a time they spent on others that had a
positive impact were happiest. Together, these results suggest that

@article{Andreoni2004a,
abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality
of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences
of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter
the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social
effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating
to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency.
We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and
controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying
subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two
supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices
actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior.


6. Conclusion


This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality
affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically
alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions.
By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like
pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity
and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising
institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To
get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two
additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving
anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This
allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices
may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more
detail.


We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing
only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the
givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but
not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing
donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each
is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends
to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification
tends to increase contributions.


Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set
a -good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period.
We found that the announcement structure has an important effect
on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly,
leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their
contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison
suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to
increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders,
we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in
the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when
information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily
identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to
decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal
with laggards is to make their actions and identities known.


Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising
practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to
remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having
the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their
highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people
the option to report their contributions results in more giving than
required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering
people with the choice to announce their contributions-even though
it is a -false' choice that no one would reject-might actually focus
them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that
indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects
in designing this feature of the giving institution.


Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly
shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh,
1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving.
People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category,
and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results
suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has
the potential to significantly increase contributions.


The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions
for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects
that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent,
out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising
institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote
efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by
shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences,
social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of
them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting
the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical
model of fund-raising practices. s},

This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not.

However, for relatively smaller and unknown charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received.

Despite subscribing to popular beliefs that charitable giving should be directed primarily to the needy, donors often support organisations that promote their own preferences, that help people with whom they feel some affinity and that support causes that relate to their own life experiences.},

abstract = {We study gender differences in altruism by examining a modieed dictator game with varying incomes and prices. Our results indicate that the question `which is the fair sex?' has a complicated answer: when altruism is expensive, women are kinder, but when it is cheap, men are more altruistic. That is, we efind that the male and female `demand curves for altruism' cross, and that men are more responsive to price changes. Furthermore, men are more likely to be either perfectly selfish or perfectly seleflss, whereas women tend to be `equalitarians' who prefer to share even ... Second, this indicates a need for more attention to sex differences in experimental economics. If differ- ences appear with respect to altruism, they may appear in other behavior as well.23 This, in turn, means that researchers would be wise to assure that their experimental endings are the result of economic incentives and not of varying sex compositions of their control and treatment groups. There are also potential applications of this result to the real world. If sex differences in altruism are truly present, as sug- gested by evidence from charitable giving and from restaurant tipping, then those who broker in altruism, such as charities and fundraisers, may end it in their interests to learn more about these differences and to exploit them in their enterprises. For tax policy, sex difference in altruism may also indicate that the inci- dence of the tax deduction to charity may differ by sex as well, with men and the charities they favor getting a greater share of the subsidy.},

discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they
conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear
whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or,
rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as
cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a
survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found
that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general;
a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop
being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects
when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The
aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women,
but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become
donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications
for research and public policy are discussed.},

A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.},

However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking."},

models with fixed effects in panel data. Up until now, no estimator
has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases
with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations
(LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case
where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are
consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions.
It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error
terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators
are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional
methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead,
the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte
Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in
small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are
easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their
asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels
of arbitrary length is briefly discussed.},

Furthermore, it predicts that identical consequences trigger different reciprocal responses in different environments.

Although this so-called -power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

abstract = {Collective Action and Status


My dissertation research addressed a central puzzle of social science:
How is social order possible among individuals who are tempted to
behave selfishly? Why and when do individuals pursue social goals
rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an
explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action
can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the
availability of increased status for those who contribute to public
goods.


In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to
collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group
members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and
(c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well
as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions
are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute
(as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of
obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth
study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions,
indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.},

abstract = {Why do fundraisers announce initial contributions to their charity?
Potential explanations are that these announcements cause future
donors to increase their contributions, either because they want
to reciprocate the generosity of earlier donors, or because the initial
contributions are seen as a signal of the charity's quality. Using
experimental methods we investigate these two hypotheses. When only
the first donor is informed of the public good's quality, subjects
not only copy the initial contribu- tion, but the first donor also
correctly anticipates this response. While this result is consistent
with both the signaling and the reciprocity explanations, the latter
is unlikely to be the driving force. The reason is that announcements
have no effect on contribution levels when the quality of the public
good is common knowledge. Thus our results provide strong support
for the signaling hypothesis. (JEL C92, D82, H4},

abstract = {We study gender differences in altruism by examining a modieed dictator game with varying incomes and prices. Our results indicate that the question `which is the fair sex?' has a complicated answer when altruism is expensive, women are kinder, but when it is cheap, men are more altruistic. That is, we efind that the male and female `demand curves for altruism' cross, and that men are more responsive to price changes. Furthermore, men are more likely to be either perfectly selfish or perfectly seleflss, whereas women tend to be `equalitarians' who prefer to share even ... Second, this indicates a need for more attention to sex differences in experimental economics. If differ- ences appear with respect to altruism, they may appear in other behavior as well.23 This, in turn, means that researchers would be wise to assure that their experimental endings are the result of economic incentives and not of varying sex compositions of their control and treatment groups. There are also potential applications of this result to the real world. If sex differences in altruism are truly present, as sug- gested by evidence from charitable giving and from restaurant tipping, then those who broker in altruism, such as charities and fundraisers, may end it in their interests to learn more about these differences and to exploit them in their enterprises. For tax policy, sex difference in altruism may also indicate that the inci- dence of the tax deduction to charity may differ by sex as well, with men and the charities they favor getting a greater share of the subsidy.},

A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.},

Although this so-called 'power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

We test hypotheses with conditional logistic regression analysis, using the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (Nhouseholds=1246; Norganizations=64). We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Empirical results are in line with our theory: in gross terms, the

Interestingly, in terms of both maximizing current contributions
and inducing participation, we find that a one-standard deviation
increase in female solicitor physical attractiveness is similar to
that of the lottery incentive.},

An impact

philanthropist is someone who wants to personally -make a difference.'
While that motive is

straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different
from other models of philanthropy.

For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact
philanthropist's charitable

fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists
can reduce aggregate giving. In

addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship
between givers and receivers in

which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict
between charitable

organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable
gifts. In particular, a charitable

organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many
goods, whereas a donor prefers to

target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

abstract = {To understand the -pure- incentives of altruism, economic laboratory
research on humans almost always forbids communication between subjects.
In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction between
givers and receivers, which clearly must influence choices. Charities,
for example, speak of the -power of asking.- Indeed, evolutionary
theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We experimentally
examine communication in which one subject allocates 10 between
herself and a receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair
could speak. We found that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased
- asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices
were significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy
was heightened by putting allocators -in the receiver's shoes,- giving
appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were
silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic
behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy.},

Freedom from Hunger implemented a test of its direct marketing solicitations, varying letters by whether they include a discussion of their program's impact as measured by scientific research. The base script, used for both treatment and control, included a standard qualitative story about an individual beneficiary. Adding scientific impact information has no effect on average likelihood of giving or average gift amount. However, we find important heterogeneity: large prior donors both are more likely to give and also give more, whereas small prior donors are less likely to give. This pattern is consistent with two different types of donors: warm glow donors who respond negatively to analytical effectiveness information, and altruism donors who respond positively to such information.},

abstract = {This paper considers estimation of truncated and censored regression
models with fixed effects in panel data. Up until now, no estimator
has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases
with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations
(LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case
where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are
consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions.
It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error
terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators
are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional
methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead,
the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte
Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in
small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are
easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their
asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels
of arbitrary length is briefly discussed.},

We find significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group" and "reference dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. This can provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.},

abstract = {Fundraising campaigns advertised via mass media are common. To what extent such campaigns affect charitable behavior is mostly unknown, however. Using giving and volunteering surveys conducted biannually from 1988 to 1996, I investigate the effect of a national fundraising campaign, "Give Five", on charitable giving and volunteering patterns. The widely advertised "Give Five" campaign was aimed to encourage people to give five percent of their income and volunteer five hours a week. After controlling for selection into being informed about the "Give Five", I find that people who were informed about the campaign increased their weekly volunteering activity on average by almost half an hour, but their giving behavior was not significantly affected. I discuss the policy implications associated with this result and argue that although the "Give Five" campaign did not achieve its goal, its economic impact was considerable.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {People are more likely to contribute to a charity when they are asked to. Although this so-called 'power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

discourage the performance of altruistic activities because they
conflict with intrinsic altruistic motivations. However, it is unclear
whether this is evidence of a generalized aversion to rewards or,
rather, an aversion to receiving specific material prizes, such as
cash. We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a
survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found
that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general;
a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop
being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects
when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The
aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women,
but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become
donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications
for research and public policy are discussed.},

We show that a very weak form of identifiability-determining the victim without providing any personalizing information-increases caring. In the first, laboratory study, subjects were more willing to compensate others who lost money when the losers had already been determined than when they were about to be. In the second, field study, people contributed more to a charity when their contributions would benefit a family that had already been selected from a list than when told that that the family would be selected from the same list.},

mechanism, especially so when it goes along with authority in the
form of granting the leader exclusion power. Whether leadership is
fixed or rotating among group members has no significant influence
on contributions. Only a minority of groups succeeds in endogenously
installing a leader, even though groups with leaders are much more
efficient than groups without a leader.},

Social norms, social perceptions, religious convictions, and other considerations may all play a role. However, beyond all those reasons, the wish to help other people, particularly when those people are in need of external help, is the core motivation for charitable giving and helping behavior. Thus, in order to better understand the psychological motivation of charitable giving, it is important to explore the factors that may increase or decrease the fundamental wish to extend help. One of the main factors that affects the wish to aid is the characteristics of the target-the recipient of the help. Why do some targets elicit outpourings of sympathy and aid, while other targets do not? In this chapter we review experimental and theoretical work on the effect of victims identifiability on charitable giving. We integrate recent findings, concentrating on the psychological processes underlying the effect and its boundary conditions.},

When students were presented with the information that many others donated to two charitable funds at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, their willingness to contribute increased. This constitutes a first test of social interaction effects in charitable giving in a field experiment. The behavior resulting from conditional cooperation is consistent with at least three theoretical approaches: first, people may want to behave in an appropriate way and to conform to a social norm; second, people have some level of fairness preferences, such as reciprocity; or third, contributions by others may serve as a signal of the quality of the public good, or of the organization that provides the good. Results from previous experiments that attempt to discriminate among the various explanations are ambiguous. Some experimental studies indicate that conformity can explain conditional cooperation better than reciprocal considerations, while others come to the opposite conclusion. Yet other laboratory experiments find evidence supporting the third mechanism, that cooperative behavior of others is used as an indication of the quality of the public good.},

The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on religious participation using a newly available individual-level panel data. Understanding these spillover effects may be quite important, given the existing literature that links religiosity to several economically important social behaviors. The results show that religious giving and participation are complements. Increasing the price of religious giving decreases not only religious contributions but also religious attendance. The implied cross-price elasticity of religious participation with respect to the after-tax price of giving is -0.27. Furthermore, a 1{\%} increase in the amount of religious contributions is associated with a 0.4{\%} increase in religious attendance. These results are robust under several different specifications and highlight the positive externalities created by charitable subsidies. They also have important implications for testing the validity of existing economic models of religious participation and giving.},

abstract = {Abstract:

A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence
of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost
to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect
reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop
an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties.
Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via
prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity)
is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives
necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models
of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the
theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists.
Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists
respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified
a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists
act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not
when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists
tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives
are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result
from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study
Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation
of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate
at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others'
prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational
incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly
reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with
our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives,
egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others'
public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus
on heterogeneity of individuals' social preferences in models of
altruism and indirect reciprocity},

We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a {\$}1:{\$}1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80{\%} (or 94{\%}) and total donations by 75{\%} (or 89{\%}) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.},

In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction between

for example, speak of the -power of asking.- Indeed, evolutionary
theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We experimentally
examine communication in which one subject allocates 10 between
herself and a receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair
could speak. We found that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased
- asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices
were significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy
was heightened by putting allocators -in the receiver's shoes,- giving
appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were
silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic
behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy.},

if a self-improvement goal is

accessible, happy (vs. neutral or unhappy) people perform better on

abstain from self-control tasks

When this email is personalised, being addressed to -Dear John- rather than -Dear Colleague-, donations significantly increase. In the second experiment, we provide some participants with information about the proportion of their colleagues who have already donated. In this case, the social norm is not to donate (only 7.5{\%} have donated). We find no negative effects of this information on future donations, and that for some, high-ranking groups, the effect is (perhaps counterintuitively) positive.

@article{Simpson2008a,
abstract = {Abstract:

A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence
of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost
to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect
reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop
an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties.
Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via
prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity)
is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives
necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models
of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the
theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists.
Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists
respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified
a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists
act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not
when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists
tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives
are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result
from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study
Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation
of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate
at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others'
prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational
incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly
reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with
our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives,
egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others'
public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus
on heterogeneity of individuals' social preferences in models of
altruism and indirect reciprocity},

abstract = {We report the results of a field experiment conducted in conjunction with a mailed fundraising campaign of a nonprofit organization. The experiment is designed to compare the response of donors to subsidies in the form of matching amounts or rebated amounts. Matching subsidies are used by many corporations as an employee benefit; the US federal tax system encourages giving using a rebate subsidy by making donations tax deductible. The design includes a control group and two levels of subsidy of each type. Our main result is that matching subsidies result in larger total donations to charities than rebate subsidies, a result that is qualitatively similar to the lab findings. The estimated price elasticities for the matching subsidy are very similar to (and insignificantly different from) the lab experiments, while rebate subsidies lead to lower contributions in the field than in the lab. Since rebates in the field involve substantial lags and additional complications as compared with the "instant rebates" of the lab, this latter difference is not unexpected. The matching results are an important step in validating lab estimates of responsiveness to subsidies of charitable giving.},

abstract = {This paper explores whether generosity in experiments is truly evidence of concern for desirable social outcomes. We conduct an experiment using a binary version of the dictator game. We introduce several treatments in which subjects are able to leave the relationship between their actions and resulting outcomes uncertain, either to themselves or to another subject influenced by those actions, thus giving subjects the moral -wiggle room- to behave self-interestedly. We find significantly less generous behavior in these manipulations, relative to a baseline in which the relationship between actions and outcomes is transparent. We conclude that many subjects behave fairly in the baseline case mainly because they intrinsically dislike appearing unfair, either to themselves or others.},

reputation-building plays a minor role in such experiments.},

Indeed, the large opportunity cost of using the standard linear raffle (in which the price per chance to win is fixed) that we find suggests the importance of mechanism design when considering the voluntary provision of public goods.},

Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects' choice of charity is impacted by third-party evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities. These third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their selected charity; local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are imprecise.},

that social pressure affects the level of charitable contributions.
We find, however, that the form of the pressure is an important determinant
of the size of health contributions. Personal forms of solicitation
appear to increase contributions, relative to impersonal forms such
as media advertisements and mail campaigns. Within the class of personal
solicitations, we find that pressure to give which is exerted by
friends is more effective than requrests by strangers. Limited evidence
was also found that some workplace relationships result in more effective
fund-raising when compared to solicitations by strangers.},

feels disapproval, whereas a contributor feels approval if he believes

abstract = {Decisions involving charitable giving often occur under the shadow of risk. A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

sample of 4,242 alumni (1926/27-1989/90 graduates) who gave cash
gifts during the 1975/76-1989/90 fiscal years. The covariance regression
model results indicate lack of statistically significant difference
between gift-giving women and men. However, the School of Business
graduates, alumni who proceeded to obtain graduate degrees from this
university, and alumni members of non-Greek social organizations
gave significantly more. Moreover, alumni contributions varied systematically
over the business cycle and a 1962 Federal Court Order to desegregate
the university racially reduced donations but not significantly.
Given the 63-year cycle studied, the growth rates of alumni donations
of money are projected to decline after roughly age 52, which falls
short of the typical retirement age.},

While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

are more altruistic toward the residual claimant than they are toward

recent designs. We find a significant effect from the hypothesized

abstract = {In the United States, charitable contributions can be deducted from taxable income making the price of giving inversely related to the marginal tax rate. The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. On the other hand, a growing body of literature documents that giving to others reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system, which results in better health and longer life expectancy. These findings imply that tax subsidies for charitable giving may have positive spillover effects on health. This paper investigates this hypothesis using data from Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), the philanthropy module of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID). Understanding the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on health is quite important given the existing literature that links health status to several important economic outcomes. The results show that charitable subsidies have positive spillover effects on health. In particular, the implied cross-price elasticity of health index with respect to giving is -0.13. These results are robust to potential endogeneity of income and highlight the positive externalities created by tax subsidies for charitable giving.},

We test the model in a second field experiment which also provides evidence that the hidden costs are anticipated. The model is estimated structurally to perform a welfare analysis. Not accounting for hidden costs overstates the welfare effects for donors by factor ten and hides potential negative welfare effects of the charity.},

@article{Andreoni2011d,
abstract = {When the government gives a gr ant to a private charitable organization, do the donors to that organization give less? If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75{\%}. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30{\%} to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70{\%} to over 100{\%} of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

as quality and development efforts, and student characteristics,

the expected correlation between institutional quality and student
wealth, and the possible endogeneity between institutional expenditures
on education (one common measure of quality) and the level of alumni
support the institution receives. This paper uses a two-stage least
squares approach with data on quality and variables correlated with
student wealth to address these issues. Quality variables are found
to have a positive impact on the average alumni gift, with that impact
most significant for private universities and liberal arts colleges.
Wealth variables also have a positive impact on the average gift,
with the estimated coefficients most significant for public universities.
Development effort is very important in determining the level of
giving for all three types of institutions.},

These results are consistent with the findings of Fetherstonhaugh et al., Jenni and Loewenstein, and others.

abstract = {We survey 1050 consumers who have just redeemed one or more open loop gift certificates to learn whether they view gift certificate income, cash gifts and non-gift income as substitutes. We find that the majority (83{\%}) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17{\%}) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80{\%} of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30{\%} when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources.},

abstract = {We randomize advertising content motivated by the psychology literature on sympathy generation and framing effects in mailings to about 185,000 prospective new donors in India. We find significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group" and "reference dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. This can provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.},

abstract = {A person's willingness to sacrifice for others is highly sensitive
to informational conditions,

but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish
between three leading

explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous
work has not adequately

distinguished. 1) Social-signaling holds that a person wants others
to think of her as fair-

minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself
that way, and 3) beliefs-based

altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person
feel. I present a model

in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer,
which can correspond to each

of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations
using the model's predictions

about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either
by the dictator's choice

or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's
choice lowers the frequency

of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based
altruism. However, I

find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about
how he was treated by a

third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism,
and revealing partial

information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant
the recipient's information

about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving,
suggesting social-signaling.

Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing
the likelihood that it

will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the
beliefs of the recipient are

held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests
that the act of giving is

largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed
to the self, or how it makes

the recipient feel.},

abstract = {Donors tend to avoid charities that dedicate a high percentage of expenses to administrative and fundraising costs, limiting the ability of nonprofits to be effective. We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a {\$}1:{\$}1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80{\%} (or 94{\%}) and total donations by 75{\%} (or 89{\%}) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.},

Potential explanations are that these announcements cause future
donors to increase their contributions, either because they want
to reciprocate the generosity of earlier donors, or because the initial
contributions are seen as a signal of the charity's quality. Using
experimental methods we investigate these two hypotheses. When only
the first donor is informed of the public good's quality, subjects
not only copy the initial contribu- tion, but the first donor also
correctly anticipates this response. While this result is consistent
with both the signaling and the reciprocity explanations, the latter
is unlikely to be the driving force. The reason is that announcements
have no effect on contribution levels when the quality of the public
good is common knowledge. Thus our results provide strong support
for the signaling hypothesis. (JEL C92, D82, H4},

abstract = {Collective Action and Status


My dissertation research addressed a central puzzle of social science:
How is social order possible among individuals who are tempted to
behave selfishly? Why and when do individuals pursue social goals
rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an
explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action
can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the
availability of increased status for those who contribute to public
goods.


In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to
collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group
members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and
(c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well
as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions
are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute
(as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of
obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth
study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions,
indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.},

abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as "FT" and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

In line with this proposition, the effective-altruism movement seeks to provide individuals with information regarding the effectiveness of charities in hopes that they will contribute to organizations that maximize the social return of their donation. In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes. In contrast to making a personal donation decision, outcome metrics are used to a much greater extent when choosing financial investments and when allocating aid resources as an agent of an organization.

Motivated by a model of conditional demand, I consider the extent to which a "temporary shock" that increases an individual's donation to one cause by a particular amount displaces her gifts to other charitable causes. I use the 2001-2007 waves of the PSID/COPPS, the first data set of its kind, to identify this. Households that give more to one type of charity tend to give more to others. However, many of the correlations between the residuals after fixed-effects regressions are negative and significant, particularly for larger donors and for certain categories of charitable giving. Given plausible econometric assumptions, the negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution. Overall, these results suggest heterogeneous motivations for giving: small givers may be mainly driven by temporary shocks and personal appeals while larger givers may have concave multi-charity warm-glow preferences.

Our study takes a step back from this literature to examine how suggestions-a direct ask for a certain amount of money-affect giving rates. We find that our suggestion amounts affect both the intensive and extensive margins: more people give and they tend to give the suggested amount.

that the emotional benefits of spending money on others (prosocial
spending) are unleashed when givers are aware of their positive impact.
In Study 1, an experiment using real charitable appeals, giving more
money to charity led to higher levels of happiness only when participants
gave to causes that explained how these funds are used to make a
difference in the life of a recipient. In Study 2, participants were
asked to reflect upon a time they spent money on themselves or on
others in a way that either had a positive impact or had no impact.
Participants who recalled a time they spent on others that had a
positive impact were happiest. Together, these results suggest that
highlighting the impact of prosocial spending can increase the emotional
rewards of giving.},

Second, the author tests whether one type of funding acts as a signal of charity quality and thus crowds in other funding. The author finds evidence that government grants crowd in private donations. Crowding in is larger for younger charities. This is consistent with signaling, if donors know less about younger charities and the signal value is stronger.

A standard model of expected utility over outcomes predicts that the individual's before choice - her ex-ante commitment conditional on her income - will be the same as her choice after the income has been revealed. Deciding -if you win, how much will you donate?- involves a commitment (i) over a donation for a state of the world that may not be realized and (ii) over uncertain income. Models involving reference-dependent utility, tangibility, and self-signaling predict more giving before, while theories of affect predict more giving after. In our online field experiment at a UK university, as well as in our laboratory experiments in Germany, charitable giving was significantly larger in the Before treatment than in the After treatment for male subjects, with a significant gender differential. Lab treatments isolated distinct mechanisms: for men, donations were higher in all treatments where the donation's collection was uncertain, whether or not the income was known. This supports a (self)-signaling explanation: commitments realized with a lower probability must involve larger amounts to have the same signaling power. Our results are directly relevant to fundraising and volunteer-recruitment strategies, and offer further evidence that we need to exercise caution in applying expected-utility theory in the presence of social preferences},

abstract = {In the United States, charitable contributions can be deducted from taxable income making the price of giving inversely related to the marginal tax rate. The existing literature documents that charitable giving is very responsive to tax subsidies, but often ignores the spillover effects of such policies. On the other hand, a growing body of literature documents that giving to others reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system, which results in better health and longer life expectancy. These findings imply that tax subsidies for charitable giving may have positive spillover effects on health. This paper investigates this hypothesis using data from Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), the philanthropy module of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID). Understanding the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on health is quite important given the existing literature that links health status to several important economic outcomes. The results show that charitable subsidies have positive spillover effects on health. In particular, the implied cross-price elasticity of health index with respect to giving is -0.13. These results are robust to potential endogeneity of income and highlight the positive externalities created by tax subsidies for charitable giving.},

This environment allows the use of administrative data to map participants' hierarchies in a network, and their approximate proximity to each-other socially. In our first experiment, participants are sent an email by the CEO asking them to donate a day's salary to charity. When this email is personalised, being addressed to -Dear John- rather than -Dear Colleague-, donations significantly increase. In the second experiment, we provide some participants with information about the proportion of their colleagues who have already donated. In this case, the social norm is not to donate (only 7.5{\%} have donated). We find no negative effects of this information on future donations, and that for some, high-ranking groups, the effect is (perhaps counterintuitively) positive. We suggest that relationships within the workplace - a concern for status relative to the CEO, or for the firm's reputation - may explain these results.},

Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many
econometric applications have neglected an important implication
of it: the standard practice of interpreting the parameters of log-linearized
models estimated by ordinary least squares as elasticities can be
highly misleading in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This paper
explains why this problem arises and proposes an appropriate estimator.
Our criticism of conventional practices and the solution we propose
extends to a broad range of economic applications where the equation
under study is log-linearized. We develop the argument using one
particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade, and apply
the proposed technique to provide new estimates of this equation.
We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the
proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

is that if the lead giver can deceive others to believe the charity

make larger contributions, which will benefit the leader. Hence,
the leader must give an unusually large amount to convey a credible

lowest opportunity cost of providing the signal, they, in equilibrium,

I investigate this question using a novel data set from Charity Navigator which provides quality ratings for 5400 charities. Since Charity Navigator prominently displays a charity------{\O}s star rating which is assigned based on its overall rating, one can identify the causal impact of a one star increase in ratings on charitable contributions with a regression discontinuity framework that exploits the threshold values of the overall ratings. I find that in general, the third party ratings have a minor and often insignificant impact on charitable contributions received by charities. However, for relatively smaller and unknown charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received. This result is robust under alternative model specifications and highlights the role of the third party ratings in not-for-profit markets.},

abstract = {Previous experimental and observational work suggests that people act more generously when they are observed and observe others in social settings. However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders.We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking." {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.},

A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

abstract = {Most donors make contributions to public goods without doing any research. Organizations that aim to increase cooperation can encourage more informed giving by providing more and detailed information to society. However, information provision is costly and organizations have limited resources. Thus, it is important for these organizations to consider the benefits of such provision. This paper investigates the capacity of information to increase public good contributions. We theoretically and experimentally examine the impact of information provision on voluntary contributions to a linear public good with an uncertain marginal per-capita return (MPCR). Uninformed subjects make contribution decisions based only on the expected MPCR (i.e. the prior distribution), while informed subjects observe the realized MPCR before contributing. Using a theoretical model of other-regarding preferences, we find that the impact of information on average contributions crucially depends on the generosity level of the population, modeled as a stochastic increase in the pro-social preferences. In particular, a less generous population substantially increases contributions in response to good news of higher than expected MPCR and reduces contributions relatively little in response to bad news of lower than expected MPCR. The opposite is true for a more generous population. Thus, the overall impact of information is to increase (reduce) average contributions when the population is less (more) generous. We find strong support for these theoretical predictions using a two-stage lab experiment. First, we measure subjects' levels of generosity in the public good game using an online experiment. Then using the data collected in the online experiment, we control for the level of generosity in the lab. Our findings are in line with the theoretical predictions, and suggest that a more targeted information provision may be a successful strategy to improve contributions to public goods.

We test our theory using novel -threshold match- treatments in field and laboratory experiments. One -threshold match- treatment more than doubles the donation rate relative to no match. To understand the mechanism behind this increase, we use a lab study to show that beliefs about peers' donations matter. Our theoretical, lab, and field results combined suggest people are more likely to donate when they believe they are more pivotal to securing matching money.

The primes are more effective when they highlight a facet of the potential donor's identity that we hypothesize to be more relevant to his sense of self: priming identity as a previous donor is more effective for more regular donors and priming identity as a local community member is more effective for people in smaller communities. Together, these results elucidate the impact of identity on behavior and demonstrate how identity primes can be implemented in practice to encourage public good provision.

Freedom from Hunger implemented a test of its direct marketing solicitations, varying letters by whether they include a discussion of their program's impact as measured by scientific research. The base script, used for both treatment and control, included a standard qualitative story about an individual beneficiary. Adding scientific impact information has no effect on average likelihood of giving or average gift amount. However, we find important heterogeneity: large prior donors both are more likely to give and also give more, whereas small prior donors are less likely to give. This pattern is consistent with two different types of donors: warm glow donors who respond negatively to analytical effectiveness information, and altruism donors who respond positively to such information.},

Donations from corporate donors for example account for 25-35{\%} of charitable income for the largest US charities, across charitable sectors. This note presents some tentative first evidence from a natural field experiment to shed light on how different types of potential donors: individuals, corporates and aristocratically titled individuals, respond to the same fundraising drive. Each donor type was randomly assigned to treatments varying in two dimensions: (i) whether information was conveyed about the existence of an anonymous lead donor, and (ii) how individual donations would be matched by the anonymous lead donor. We find that aristocrats are significantly more likely to respond and that corporates give significantly more than individuals. Treatment effects moreover suggest that (proportional) matching is to be avoided for corporate donors.},

In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large- scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of "choice- option" defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a "scale-back" effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a lower-bar" effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a "default- distraction" effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However, the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a "self- canceling" intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for research on fundraising specifically, for choice architecture and behavioral interventions more generally, and for the use of "nudges" in policy decisions.},

We conduct a large-scale real-effort experiment with eighteen treatment arms. We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives.We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually. As a further comparison, we present a metaanalysis of similar treatments in the literature. Overall, predictions based on the literature are correlated with, but underperform, the expert forecasts.},

In, this paper, I survey the empirical evidence from the field on these three classes of deviations. The evidence covers a number of applications, from consumption to finance, from crime to voting, from charitable giving to labor supply. In the class of nonstandard preferences, I discuss time preferences (self-control problems), risk preferences (reference dependence), and social preferences. On nonstandard beliefs, I present evidence on over-confidence, on the law of small numbers, and on projection bias. Regarding nonstandard decision, making, I cover framing, limited attention, menu effects, persuasion and social pressure, and emotions. I also present evidence on how rational actors-firms, employers, CEOs, investors, and politicians-respond to the nonstandard behavior described in, the survey. Finally, I briefly discuss under what conditions experience and,market interactions limit the impact of the nonstandard features.},

abstract = {Decisions involving charitable giving often occur under the shadow of risk. A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behavior could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this paper shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.},

abstract = {Two main reasons why people donate to charity are that they have been asked and asked by someone they care about. One would therefore expect that charitable organizations could benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising if they were able to persuade donors to do so for them. However, little is known on the costs and benefits of asking donors to fundraise. We investigate this by implementing a field experiment embedded in an online giving organization's web page. In our experiment, donors who have completed an online transaction were randomly asked to share having donated by posting on their Facebook (FB) wall or by sending a private message to a friend on FB. To further explore the impact of incentives on the willingness to fundraise, donors were also assigned to one of three treatments in which the organization added either {\$}0, {\$}1 or {\$}5 in the donor's name in exchange for sharing the information. We have several findings: (1) Donors respond to incentives: larger add-on donations increase the willingness to post having made a donation. (2) Nuisance costs may be important: willingness to post is over two times higher among those already logged into FB. (3) The type of ask matters: willingness to post via one's wall or via a private message is different. (4) There are benefits to incentivizing peer-to-peer fundraising in increased new donations. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

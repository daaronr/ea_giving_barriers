<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> General relevance to effective giving</h2>
<p>For people to choose one product over another on the basis of some characteristic (e.g., safety, taste, or durability), they presumably must be <em>aware</em> of these differences before purchasing. Economists note [ref] the difficulty of investing in producing, marketing and selling high-quality products and services when consumers have difficulty distinguishing these products from inferior ones. This is especially difficult when the quality of a product is not known before purchase (an ‘Experience good’<sup>[ref]</sup> such as a ticket to a particular stage show), or when it is not known until a long time later, if at all (a ‘credence good’ such as a health remedy or investment advice.)</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Insert abundant references here to asymmetric information, fly-by-night competition, and experience and creedence goods, product reviews, regulation, advertising as a signal, etc.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Considering a charitable donation as a product purchased by the donor, it seems to fall into the latter category<sup>[ref to authors making this point]</sup>. If donors value their ‘marginal impact on outcomes’ as discussed in our earlier <a href="present-puzzle.html#def-impact">definitions of impact</a>, they may need to do extensive research (or at least know about and visit web sites such as <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a> and <a href="http://impactmatters.org">ImpactMatters</a>) to have some estimate of the value-for-money they are getting.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Donors may also be uncertain about other benefits they main gain from each donation such as ‘gratitude and long-term sense of fulfillment’.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A typical charitable donor, particularly one who donates towards a geographically-distant intervention, will never directly see or experience the consequences of her donation.</p>
<p>Thus, for people to systematically choose to donate to the most effective charities, presumably…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>They must understand and value the idea of effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p>They must either:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>know how effective charities are relative to one another,</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>have reliable information on this presented to them by the charities (or other entities),</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>or they must want to and find it appropriate to seek information on this, and be able to obtain reliable information.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>(For b or c to have the desired effect…) The act of learning about effectiveness must not substantially decrease their willingness to donate.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
In this section we consider the evidence for</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I. People’s aversion/willingness (or sense that it is appropriate/inappropriate) to evaluate effectiveness in a charitable giving context</p></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li>The impact of being presented with (or actively pursuing) effectiveness information (which is naturally <em>analytical</em> information) on generosity and the willingness to donate</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Effectiveness information may also affect how donors perceive the <em>social signaling</em> value of their donation. We return to this in the <a href="social.html#social">signaling and social pressures…</a> section.</p>

<p>Further ‘grant-worthy’ motivation (unfold).</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>As noted above, scientific evidence suggesting that organizations’ “cost per outcome” differs substantially, perhaps by a factor of 1000 or more <span class="citation">(Jamison, Karlan, and Schechter <a href="#ref-jamisonDeceiveNotDeceive2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. This has motivated an increasing focus on charity effectiveness, spearheaded by initiatives from the Rockefeller and Gates foundations. Furthermore, organizations like <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a> now provide direct ratings on the basis of per-dollar impact (e.g., cost per life saved), and are reaching out to larger audiences. This approach might boost giving, by leveraging donors’ preferences for contributions “to be put to good use”—i.e., for direct interventions.</p>
<p>E.g., In <span class="citation">Aknin et al. (<a href="#ref-Aknin2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> participants reported greater happiness when the impact of their contribution was highlighted. <span class="citation">(van Iwaarden et al. <a href="#ref-vaniwaardenCharitiesHowImportant2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Aknin et al. <a href="#ref-Aknin2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, while we have rigorous evidence on what works and doesn’t work in anti-poverty and health interventions (acknowledged by the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2019/press-release/">2019 Economics Nobel Prize</a>), we actually know very little about how potential donors react to this impact information!

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Theoretical/conceptual discussion</h3>
<p>For this to be considered a bias, the relevant individuals must intrinsically value the usefulness of their charitable activity at least to some extent. I.e., they must be Moral Utilitarians, at least in part, or for some of the time. However, they may consider it very costly or distasteful to actually do this evaluation, or it may clash with other motivations and tendencies.</p>
<p>This aversion also must be distinguished from a lack of <em>ability</em> to do CBA in the charity domain; the latter would instead be considered a <a href="quant-biases.html#quant-biases">quantitative bias</a>.</p>

<p>In the final stage of an experiment from <span class="citation">Null (<a href="#ref-Null2011b" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subjects were given the option to spend USD 5 of their total gift to the
development charities in order to find out which of the three would
receive a matching rate of USD 3 (the other two would receive matching
rates of USD 1.50). Altruistic subjects whose donation was at least USD 20
and gave to all three charities, or whose total gift is greater than
USD 35 and gave to two charities, would find it profitable to purchase
the information. … (84%) met these criteria on gift size and number
of charities supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…only 40% of subjects were willing to give up a small portion of
their endowments in order to find out which charity would receive the
highest rate; the rest preferred to allocate their gifts without
knowing what they would be worth to the charities."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...These subjects who chose not to purchase the information
forfeited matching funds ranging from 30-150% of the value of their
unmatched gifts, with the median donor sacrificing matching funds
exactly equal to the value of her unmatched gift, a truly staggering
sum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Null attributes this failure to buy information either to subjects who “simply did not care about the potential to substitute into the charity with the highest matching rate”, perhaps driven by some form of simplistic warm glow motive, or to simple misunderstanding or fatigue (in an incentivized elicitation, she found some evidence of incomplete comprehension). To the extent this is <em>not</em> a misunderstanding, it might be seen as evidence of CBA aversion; participants did not want to purchase evidence that would require them to do calculations in this domain.</p>

<!-- Todo: investigate these references...

While most donors say their primary motivation is to make a difference, few donors seek information about charities before deciding where to give (Camber Collective, 2015; Hope Consulting, 2010, 2011; Osili et al., 2016). When they do conduct research, data on impact ranks lower than other types of information, such as the charity’s financial overhead and the demographics of the program recipients (Metzger & Günther, 2019)

<p>Many participants who choose to donate positive amounts to multiple charities in earlier (?stages) continue to donate to multiple charities when one charity is given a better match rate; they only “imperfectly substitute” (and some even substitute away from the now “lower-priced” charity).

<p>She also introduces exogenous risks over matching rates, and notes that roughly 2/3 of those that choose to shift only imperfectly are not measured to be “risk averse”.</p>

<p>Participants were asked to evaluate how they believe they should make decisions across six decision domains (choosing a charity, an investment, a cell phone, a restaurant, a piece of art, and a medical treatment). Specifically, they evaluated the extent to which they agreed with the following statements: “It is important that the _____ I choose reflects my personal tastes or values,” “It is more important to rely on objective measures rather than personal feelings when choosing _____,” and “Objective measures are the best way to choose _____.” Responses were made on a scale from 1 (<em>not at all</em>) to 7 (<em>very much so</em>).</p>

<p>The treatment-- which charity Mary felt an emotional connection to-- had a significant impact on the response to “Which charity should Mary donate to”, in the predicted direction.</p>

<p>They were also asked: “Which option does the greatest good for the greatest number of people?”; here responses favored the international charity for both treatments; but even so, when Mary felt connected to local charity, participants favored her donating there.</p>
<p>(Unfold for the authors’ description of this methodology and results…)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Methodology from <span class="citation">Berman et al. (<a href="#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants read a scenario involving Mary, who was looking to donate money to one of two hypothetical charities. One charity, Hunger Care in Africa, was described as providing micronutrients for children in Africa, and for each USD 100 donated, this charity could feed five children for a month. A second charity, Jump Start Your Community, was described as training and educating the homeless in Mary’s community, and for every USD 100 donated, this charity could provide 2 hr of job training to one homeless person</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each participant was then randomly assigned to one of two emotional-connection conditions. In the local-causes condition, participants read that Mary feels an emotional connection toward helping people in local communities, whereas in the distant-causes condition, participants read that Mary feels an emotional connection toward helping those in third-world countries</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We then presented participants with two different questions on separate pages in random order. One question assessed where they felt Mary should donate (“Which charity should Mary donate to?”), whereas the other question asked which charity was the most effective at maximizing social welfare (“Suppose that Mary wanted to donate to the charity that did the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Which one should she donate to?”). Both questions were measured on a 7-point scale from 1 (definitely Jump Start Your Community) to 7 (definitely Hunger Care in Africa)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation">Berman et al. (<a href="#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> summarized their results from this study as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When participants read that Mary felt an emotional connection with distant charities, they responded that she should donate to Hunger Care in Africa… and also evaluated it as being more effective… However, when Mary felt connected to local communities, they indicated that she should donate to Jump Start Your Community…, despite indicating that Hunger Care in Africa was more effective</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Somewhat puzzlingly, Mary's connection to the charity also
affected the stated “effectiveness” response! This bears a closer
examination</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In their “Study 3: Charity Versus Investment Choice”, subjects were assigned categories and fictional examples of either charities or investment, and presented domain categories and effectiveness information for each. Fewer participants in the charity treatment (relative to the investment treatment) chose to sort by effectiveness rating, and fewer chose the highest rated option.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
(Unfold for further discussion of study 3…)

<div class="fold">
<p>Study 3 built on the ideas from Study 1. Effective altruism suggests that to make the biggest difference, people should try and maximize welfare, similar to how investors try and maximize their financial returns. However, Study 1 suggested that individuals viewed objective information as more important in making financial decisions than in charitable decisions. The third study from <span class="citation">Berman et al. (<a href="#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> tries to more directly compare the two, using the following method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants were also told that the website organizes options into six different categories (alternative energy, cancer, education, food, housing, and international). These categories were chosen because they could plausibly represent groupings of either charities or investments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants were then given the choice to sort the options either by effectiveness or by category type. Sorting by effectiveness suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting one of the most effective charities or investments, whereas sorting by category suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting a charity or investment that reflected a preferred option type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They found that participants were significantly more likely to sort by effectiveness in the investment condition than in the charity condition. Furthermore, when the options were ranked, “participants chose a less effective charity… than investment”.</p>
</div>
<p>Study 4 and 5 both examined how responsibility changes people’s perception of how important objective information is. <span class="citation">Berman et al. (<a href="#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> hypothesized that “when individuals assume a role of responsibility, they may feel obligated to act in accordance with the welfare of the entire group and will discount their personal preferences to do so”.</p>
<p>In Study 4, they find that, in rating research departments for funding, participants pay more attention to charity effectiveness ratings when the are given the “role” of a “president of a local medical research center” rather than a donor. Similarly, in Study 5 participants assess someone who allocates funds to a research department; participants respond to the effectiveness of the department chosen more when rating the decision quality and altruism/selfishness of a “president…” than rating a “donor”.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
(Unfold for further details of study 4…)

<div class="fold">
<p>In Study 4, participants were assigned to a donor condition or a president condition, and then participants were either given information on effectiveness ratings, or there was no mention of effectiveness ratings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants assigned to the donor condition imagined that they lived near a local research center. Participants assigned to the president condition imagined that they were the president of a local medical research center. Participants in the donor condition were then told that “because the market has done well, you have more cash than usual. You would like to help by making a donation to medical research.” Participants in the president condition were told that “Because the stock market has done well, the research center has more cash than usual. As president, it is part of your job to allocate these funds to conduct additional medical research.”
Each participant was then given his or her choice between allocating funds to one of three departments, with effectiveness ratings provided for each department… These ratings were purposefully selected so that the most intuitively appealing choice was rated as the least effective (cancer), and the least appealing choice was rated as the most effective (arthritis), thereby creating a tension between the option that would be most personally gratifying and the option that would maximize welfare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their results suggested that people paid more attention to the effectiveness ratings when they were in a position of responsibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the effectiveness ratings were absent, the assigned role did not significantly affect the option that participants chose… However, when the ratings were present, participants in the president condition were significantly more likely to select higher rated options than those in the donor condition… Although participants used effectiveness ratings when given this information, significantly more did so when placed in a position of responsibility</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
Study 5 details (unfold)

<div class="fold">
<p>Their fifth study used a similar methodology to Study 4, to examine “how individuals judge others who select either a relatively effective or an ineffective option”, using the following method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The study has a 2 (role: donor vs. medical center president) x 2 (choice: most effective option vs. least effective option) between-subjects design. Participants read a scenario about Mr. Peterson, an individual who was allocating money to a local medical research center. In the donor condition, participants read that Mr. Peterson was looking to donate money from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center. In the president condition, participants read that Mr. Peterson was the president of the medical research center and that he was looking to allocate surplus funds from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center
In all conditions, participants then read about an independent research firm that evaluates the effectiveness of departments in the same fashion as the previous study
… Participants then evaluated the extent to which they thought the decision was responsible, appropriate, and thoughtful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with Study 4, the results suggested that people thought effectiveness information was more important for people in positions of responsibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr. Peterson’s decision was of lower quality when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, the drop in decision quality was significantly greater when he was president… than when he was a donor
In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr. Peterson’s decision was less altruistic when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, this difference was greater when Mr. Peterson was president… than when he was a donor</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Overall, these suggest that, when considering charitable donations,
people tend to favor–or at least to accept–the use of subjective
preferences and personal ties, rather than objective information, and
they do so more than for more “standard” goods and choices. This is more
accepted for “donors” than for people with responsibility for others’
funds.</p>
<p>In their analysis of the studies, <span class="citation">Berman et al. (<a href="#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> concluded with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our results suggest that people view charity decisions as being relatively subjective, which inhibits the impact of effectiveness information on welfare maximization. Thus, to persuade people to make donation decisions that maximize social welfare, providing information alone may not be sufficient. Rather, it may require altering how individuals view their role as a donor altogether</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Berman et al argue that their results demonstrate the acceptance of the suggestive preferences is somewhat attenuated by the "role of responsibility", but it's not clear what this term means or how this could be relevant to voluntary individual giving.</p>
</div>
<p>However (as they do note), the effectiveness information
still has <em>some</em> (positive) effect on participants’ responses; it is not
ignored. Their experiments also do not analyze the <em>avoidance</em> of
information or CBA.</p>

We find the least demand for information about aid impact, indicating that individuals either do not understand, do not trust, or do not care about the specific information we provide. Average donations increase in response to information about the recipient type and decrease in response to information about administrative costs. Information about aid impact does not significantly change average donations: donors who demand information respond positively to high impact projects and negatively to low impact projects, resulting in a zero net effect on donation levels. Our results further show that information has the same effect on donation behavior regardless of whether it is provided for free or at a cost.

> ... exact information about aid impact did not lead to a significant change in average donation levels, while information about the exact recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in donation levels.

> In the recipient type group, informed participants donated significantly more than uninformed participants because they "rewarded" the preferred recipient with higher-than-average transfers. In the administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly less than uninformed participants because they used the information to "punish" NGOs with high administration costs.

DR: It is not clear to me when they are reporting on the self-selected groups and when they report on the sample overall, or in a way that deals with the self-selection.

Looking at their one clearer result, we see a lack of power.

Average don:    2.45 CHF

Aid impact group coef: -.231 (.45)

This looks like an underpowered study. They can perhaps rule out an effect greater than around half of the average donation, but no more precisely.

<p>A subjective outline of the evidence:</p>
<p>The evidence (from the Economics/Behavioral Economics literature) is largely mixed and indeterminate. There has been only a single strong field trial <span class="citation">(Karlan and Wood <a href="#ref-karlanEffectEffectivenessDonor2017a" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#ref-karlanEffectEffectivenessDonor2017a" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> in a particular context, which itself reported mixed (null overall, positive for some subgroups, negative for others), and some underpowered results. Laboratory experiments (with real donations) by Small et al find that giving to an identifiable victim is <em>reduced</em> when statistics are also presented and “priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime.” Further evidence from lab experiments is mixed and limited, with some studies <span class="citation">(Fong and Oberholzer-Gee <a href="#ref-fongTruthGivingExperimental2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a><a href="#ref-fongTruthGivingExperimental2010" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> <em>apparently</em> finding that exogenous information about recipient increases donations (although they do not report this). There is some speculation, but again, mixed evidence, that individuals already in a “system 2” (deliberative) frame are more likely to be positively affected by impact information. There is also a distinction to be further explored between “output information” (how the donation is used) and “impact information”; the former is seen to increase generosity in several studies.</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>(This is all direct quotations:)</p>
<p>Potential donors were sent, via a direct mail
campaign, fundraising appeals containing varying amounts of financial and nonfinancial
information in order to determine whether individual donors are more likely to contribute
when accounting information or voluntary disclosures are provided …</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A logistic regression provides evidence that some donors who have previously
donated use financial accounting information when making a donation decision. The
results are inconclusive regarding whether donors use nonfinancial service efforts and
accomplishments disclosures to determine whether and how much to give, but participants in the lab experiment judged the nonfinancial disclosures to be useful for making
a giving decision</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Both experiments use a two-by-two design to manipulate the direct provision of (1)
financial information (derived from mandatory informational tax filings which are available
only if requested by the donor) and (2) voluntary disclosure of nonfinancial accounting
information (not otherwise available to the donor). By analyzing actual cash receipts from
the fundraising appeal, I find that donors who had previously contributed to the organization
are more likely to donate when financial accounting information is directly provided. New
prospective donors make larger contributions when either financial information or voluntary,
nonfinancial accounting information is included with a basic fundraising appeal, but differences are not statistically significant.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The first manipulation is to include financial information
drawn from the audited financial statements with the basic fundraising appeal. Summary
charts and graphs, instead of full financial statements complete with footnotes, are used to
highlight the efficiency measures typically emphasized in previous literature. The financial
information indicates that 92.5 percent of the entity’s expenditures were directed to program
expenses in the prior year. This figure compares favorably with the 60 percent suggested
minimum level recommended by the National Charities Information Bureau</p>
<p><br />
The second manipulation is to include a voluntary disclosure of service efforts and
accomplishments (SEA) that describes the organization’s past efforts to serve its beneficiaries and gives specific information about the success of its programs (see Appendix C).
This information is in narrative form and written in lay terms. 3 It provides both output
(quantity of product or service produced) and outcomes (results) information as defined in
Hatry et al. (1990).</p>

<p>From Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across six experiments we examined how images of identified victims interact with information about charity efficiency (money toward program) and effectiveness (program outcome). We further examined if the images primarily get people to donate (yes/no), while efficiency/effectiveness might provide a tuning mechanism for how much to give. Results showed that images influenced the propensity to donate and induced participants donate their full bonuses, indicating heuristic effects. Efficiency and effectiveness information had no effects on donations.</p>

<p>Notes on above table:</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>(Note that in the above, all binary variables are ‘effect coded’)
Considering ‘Don share’ (the share of the endowment contributed), as well as the linear probability model, we see that the pooled effect of the effectiveness information is fairly tightly bounded around zero. Even at the 95% lower bound, the effect is no more than an 11% reduction in the share donated (.04/0.35), and a 10% reduction in incidence (.06/.62).</p>

Study 6 had the most straightforward ‘impact information’ as per our definitions.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Above we see estimated of odds ratios, relative to the control group, of the incidence of donating to RB (Carter Center: the river-blindness charity) and GD (Guide Dogs for the blind). Confidence intervals reveal a lack of power. However, there is suggestive evidence (p=0.09 and p=0.16, respectively) that the image lead people to be less-likely to donate to GD and more likely to donate to RB. This may have been driven by the African appearance of the blind girl depicted.</p>

<p>Other comments (unfold)</p>

<div class="fold">
<p>Comments from Janek Kretschmer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The author considers three aspects of the ‘problem’ with beliefs: no-reward for actual high impact, punishment for low impact, and reward for unrealistic high impact. This might be reduced to the simple assumption that actual cost-effectiveness information can not live up to donors’ expectations [which] makes an investment into scientific evaluation unprofitable for NGOs.</p></li>
<li><p>The results may largely be explained by the evaluation bias (Caviola et al. 2014). This could be emphasized further.</p></li>
<li><p>In study 3, the presentation of possible overhead spending is potentially too negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, after accounting for overhead the difference between both scenarios is small 2000 USD vs. 1800 USD, and more mental resources are required to obtain this conclusion</p></li>
<li><p>More information about the “another charity option” would be helpful. Ideally, the author would provide the participants’ decision screen in the appendix.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the author wonders whether “active donors […] differ from the general population,” she asks a relevant question (cf. Karlan and Woods, 2017). However, she simply provides the mean donation (M = 70.9 USD) to Human Health International among respondents who have donated in the past twelve months. Thus, it can be said that there is no statistical difference from the mean donation (M = 69.9 USD) among all respondents, including non-donors However, the more interesting question “do large donors react differently to the four conditions?” remains answered.</p>

<strong>Relevance</strong>: Reasonably strong causal evidence that in general, charity ratings may boost a charity’s fundraising, at least for some types of charities. However, this is based on Charity Navigator ratings, which do not generally agree with our measures of impact.</p>

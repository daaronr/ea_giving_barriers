<p>For people to choose one product over another product on the basis of some characteristic (e.g., safety, taste, or durability), they presumably must be <em>aware</em> of these differences before purchasing. Economists note the difficulty of investing in producing, marketing and selling high-quality products and services when consumers have difficulty distinguishing these products from inferior ones ( <span class="citation" data-cites="dulleckDoctorsMechanicsComputer2006">Dulleck and Kerschbamer (<a href="references.html#ref-dulleckDoctorsMechanicsComputer2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="nelson1970">Nelson (<a href="references.html#ref-nelson1970" role="doc-biblioref">1970</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="shapiroOptimalPricingExperience1983">Shapiro (<a href="references.html#ref-shapiroOptimalPricingExperience1983" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>). This is especially difficult when the quality of a product is not known before purchase (an ‘experience good’ such as a ticket to a particular stage show, see ibid), or when it is not known until a long time later, if at all (a ‘credence good’ such as a health remedy or investment advice <span class="citation" data-cites="dulleckDoctorsMechanicsComputer2006">Dulleck and Kerschbamer (<a href="references.html#ref-dulleckDoctorsMechanicsComputer2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>)</p>
<!-- Maybe insert further references here to asymmetric information, fly-by-night competition, and experience and credence goods, product reviews, regulation, advertising as a signal, etc. (this is a mainstream literature)-->
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Considering a charitable donation as a ‘product purchased by the donor’, it seems to fall into the latter category of ‘credence good’. If donors value their ‘marginal impact on outcomes’ as discussed in our earlier <a href="present_puzzle.html#def-impact">definitions of impact</a>, they may need to do extensive research (or at least know about and visit web sites such as <a href="http://givewell.org">GiveWell</a>) to have some estimate of the value-for-money they are getting.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>A typical charitable donor, particularly one who donates towards a geographically-distant intervention, will never directly see or experience the consequences of her donation. Thus, for people to systematically choose to donate to the most effective charities, presumably…</p>

<p>People may be reluctant<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to consider the cost and benefits of the actions they are funding through their charitable donations (or they find this less appropriate/normal). This contrasts with a much greater willingness to consider these and other domains such as consumption, investment, and public policy. People also seem to avoid accessing/buying/seeing information (particularly information that may be likely to make them feel compelled to give.)</p>
<!--
JS:

I suppose one model of charitable giving is that most folks are just blindly pulling the name of a charity out of a hat, and since there are many more ineffective charities than effective charities, they are more likely to donate to an ineffective charity. If the average donor gets the same warm glow no matter where she donates and she is only motivated by feelings of warm glow, then pulling names out of a hat isn't a bad strategy.

DR:
True. But it can't be just 'throw your money at anything' ... because if so we'd have even less effectiveness than we do, and I can't imagine people happy knowing their donation was literally 'thrown in a whole with no impact at all'.

<p>For this to be considered a <em>bias</em>, the relevant individuals must intrinsically value the usefulness of their charitable activity at least to some extent.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> However, they may consider it very costly or distasteful to actually <em>do</em> this evaluation, or it may clash with other motivations and tendencies.</p>
<p>This aversion also must be distinguished from a lack of <em>ability</em> to do CBA in the charity domain; the latter would instead be considered a <a href="quant-biases.html">quantitative bias</a>.</p>
<p>The reluctance to engage in this evaluation process may relate to the idea of “taboo trade-offs”; if these tradeoffs are taboo, considering them may involve great emotional distress.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

As these authors note, the belief that <em>CBA is not a natural part of the charitable domain</em> may stem from the lack of direct feedback one gets from donating (in Economics terms, a “credence” good) relative to consumption and investment goods.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Null attributes this failure to buy information either to subjects who “simply did not care about the potential to substitute into the charity with the highest matching rate”, perhaps driven by some form of simplistic warm glow motive, or to simple misunderstanding or fatigue (in an incentivized elicitation, she found some evidence of incomplete comprehension).

<p>Our main results are the following. First, while only 28.73% (se = 0.03) of the participants in the treatment group buy the offered information, 57.09% (se = 0.02) donate to charity. That means, about 28% of the participants make an uninformed donation. Second, demand varies considerably across information types.

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Last, we find that non-buyers do not respond to information: they hardly change their donation behavior when they receive information for free.

<p>The comparison to the purchases of information in the other context also seems overstated.

Then the second option introduces "personal feelings." But feelings are neither values nor tastes! I'm not sure at all how I would choose between these options. I want a charity that does objectively well according to the values I believe are objectively true.

<p>Study 3 built on the ideas from Study 1. Effective altruism suggests that to make the biggest difference, people should try to maximize welfare, analogously investors seeking maximize their financial returns. However, Study 1 suggested that individuals viewed objective information as more important in making <em>financial</em> decisions than in charitable decisions. The third study from <span class="citation" data-cites="Berman2018">Berman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> tries to more directly compare the two, using the following method:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Participants were also told that the website organizes options into six different categories (alternative energy, cancer, education, food, housing, and international). These categories were chosen because they could plausibly represent groupings of either charities or investments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Participants were then given the choice to sort the options either by effectiveness or by category type. Sorting by effectiveness suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting one of the most effective charities or investments, whereas sorting by category suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting a charity or investment that reflected a preferred option type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They found that participants were significantly more likely to sort by effectiveness in the investment condition than in the charity condition. Furthermore, when the options were ranked, “participants chose a less effective charity… than investment”.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Study 4 and 5 both examined how responsibility changes people’s perception of how important objective information is. <span class="citation" data-cites="Berman2018">Berman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> hypothesized that “when individuals assume a role of responsibility, they may feel obligated to act in accordance with the welfare of the entire group and will discount their personal preferences to do so”.</p>
<p>In Study 4, they find that, in rating research departments for funding, participants pay more attention to charity effectiveness ratings when the are given the “role” of a “president of a local medical research center” rather than a donor. Similarly, in Study 5 participants assess someone who allocates funds to a research department; participants respond to the effectiveness of the department chosen more when rating the decision quality and altruism/selfishness of a “president…” than rating a “donor”.</p>
<!--

JS: This seems like a really important result. How can we get people to adopt a similar viewpoint when making real donation decisions?

DR: I didn't find this so compelling. Mainly because it seemed sort of obvious to me the way it was phrased. But maybe there is a way this can be adapted to get people to think of their donations as they would assess a 'leader decisionmaker'

<p>In Study 4, participants were assigned to a donor condition or a president condition, and then participants were either given information on effectiveness ratings, or there was no mention of effectiveness ratings.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Participants assigned to the donor condition imagined that they lived near a local research center. Participants assigned to the president condition imagined that they were the president of a local medical research center. Participants in the donor condition were then told that “because the market has done well, you have more cash than usual. You would like to help by making a donation to medical research.” Participants in the president condition were told that “Because the stock market has done well, the research center has more cash than usual. As president, it is part of your job to allocate these funds to conduct additional medical research.” Each participant was then given his or her choice between allocating funds to one of three departments, with effectiveness ratings provided for each department… These ratings were purposefully selected so that the most intuitively appealing choice was rated as the least effective (cancer), and the least appealing choice was rated as the most effective (arthritis), thereby creating a tension between the option that would be most personally gratifying and the option that would maximize welfare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their results suggested that people paid more attention to the effectiveness ratings when they were in a position of responsibility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When the effectiveness ratings were absent, the assigned role did not significantly affect the option that participants chose… However, when the ratings were present, participants in the president condition were significantly more likely to select higher rated options than those in the donor condition… Although participants used effectiveness ratings when given this information, significantly more did so when placed in a position of responsibility</p>

<p>Their fifth study used a similar methodology to Study 4, to examine “how individuals judge others who select either a relatively effective or an ineffective option”, using the following method:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The study has a 2 (role: donor vs.&nbsp;medical center president) x 2 (choice: most effective option vs.&nbsp;least effective option) between-subjects design. Participants read a scenario about Mr.&nbsp;Peterson, an individual who was allocating money to a local medical research center. In the donor condition, participants read that Mr.&nbsp;Peterson was looking to donate money from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center. In the president condition, participants read that Mr.&nbsp;Peterson was the president of the medical research center and that he was looking to allocate surplus funds from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center In all conditions, participants then read about an independent research firm that evaluates the effectiveness of departments in the same fashion as the previous study … Participants then evaluated the extent to which they thought the decision was responsible, appropriate, and thoughtful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with Study 4, the results suggested that people thought effectiveness information was more important for people in positions of responsibility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr.&nbsp;Peterson’s decision was of lower quality when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, the drop in decision quality was significantly greater when he was president… than when he was a donor In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr.&nbsp;Peterson’s decision was less altruistic when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, this difference was greater when Mr.&nbsp;Peterson was president… than when he was a donor</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Overall, these suggest that, when considering charitable donations, people tend to favor–or at least to accept–the use of subjective preferences and personal ties, rather than objective information, and they do so more than for more “standard” goods and choices. This is more accepted for “donors” than for people with responsibility for others’ funds.</p>
<p>In their analysis of the studies, <span class="citation" data-cites="Berman2018">Berman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Berman2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> concluded with the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our results suggest that people view charity decisions as being relatively subjective, which inhibits the impact of effectiveness information on welfare maximization. Thus, to persuade people to make donation decisions that maximize social welfare, providing information alone may not be sufficient. Rather, it may require altering how individuals view their role as a donor altogether<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However (as they do note), the effectiveness information still has <em>some</em> (positive) effect on participants’ responses; it is not ignored. Their experiments also do not analyze the <em>avoidance</em> of information or CBA.</p>

Laboratory experiment, donations to high/low-performing NGO


-  Mixed and  weak evidence on excuse-driven information-seeking

**Caveats**


The opportunity to buy info on 'recipient type' increased giving, while the opportunity to buy information on 'administrated costs' decreased giving (marginal significance for both). They found no effect of the opportunity to buy information on 'aid impact', but this had wide condident intervals

Providing 'free information' on each of these had insignificant effects, but they seem underpowered here



The 'lack of power...'


Looking at a clearer result, we see a lack of power.

Average don:    2.45 CHF

'Aid impact group' coeficient: -.231 (.45)

This looks like an underpowered study. They can perhaps rule out an effect greater than around half of the average donation, but no more precisely.

> In the recipient type group, informed participants donated significantly more than uninformed participants because they "rewarded" the preferred recipient with higher-than-average transfers. In the administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly less than uninformed participants because they used the information to "punish" NGOs with high administration costs.

DR: It is not clear to me when they are reporting on the self-selected groups and when they report on the sample overall, or in a way that deals with the self-selection.

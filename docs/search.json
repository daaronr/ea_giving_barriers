    "text": "1\n2\n(I) Limited giving to those most in need: When faced with the “girl drowning in the pond” we are willing to sacrifice substantial wealth to save a life. However, most people don’t make large donations to the very poor (see, e.g., Meer and Priday (2020)), in spite of evidence suggesting that lives can be saved for less than 5,000 USD in expectation (and people’s apparent belief that it is even cheaper).3\n(II) Inefficiency of charitable giving: There is a strong case that most donations go to charities that improve well-being far less per-dollar than others. The figure below depicts estimates of ‘cost per additional disease-adjusted-life-year (DALY)’ from the most promising health interventions.4\n5\nIn contrast, charity-supported interventions such as providing guide dogs for the blind routinely cost over 5000 USD per dog per year, presumably yielding substantially less than a single DALY of benefit per year. Make-a-Wish ‘wishes’ for dying children cost over 11,000 USD on average; the same money may be able to save as many as three children’s lives (on average) if devoted to (e.g.) seasonal preventative anti-malarial drugs.6\nIn general, most charitable giving goes towards helping people in wealthier countries,* even though it is widely accepted that far more lives can be saved and improved when funds are devoted towards more effective interventions in poor countries (see fold).7\nAs Burum, Nowak, and Hoffman (2020) state: “We donate billions of dollars to charities each year, yet much of our giving is ineffective. Why are we motivated to give, but not motivated to give effectively?”\nThe above points (I) and (II) raises two related questions:\nI. “Why don’t we give more to the most effective charities and to those most in need?”, and\nII. “Why are we not more efficient with our giving choices?”\nTo address this, we must understand what drives giving choices, and how people react to the presentation of charity-effectiveness information.8"

    "section": "2.1 Motivation and descriptives",
    "text": "2.1 Motivation and descriptives\nIndividual donors, governments and firms demonstrate substantial generosity (e.g., UK charity represents 0.5-1% of GDP, US charity around 2% of GDP).9, 10\nHowever, most donations go towards charities that are worthwhile but improve human well-being far less per dollar than basic medical interventions in poor countries, such as antimalarial bednets (see Givewell.org). Even within the same category, more can be achieved for less: e.g. while it costs around USD 50,000 to provide a blind person a guide dog, the equivalent amount may be able to be used to prevent many cases of visual impairment from trachoma for many people (Burton and Mabey 2009) through preventative measures and surgery, perhaps more than 50.11\nSocial science, biology and philosophy present a range of potential theoretical explanations of how values, preferences, and biases drive this ‘inefficient altruism’. However, evidence (e.g., for ‘availability bias’, or for ‘scope insensitivity’) comes largely from small-scale experiments in domains outside of charitable-giving. It is difficult to distinguish robust, credible findings from one-off results that are vulnerable to hype, p-hacking and publication bias (echoing the ‘replication crisis’ in experimental social science (Shrout and Rodgers 2018)). Given the limited, scattered findings, we do not have a definitive picture of which factors substantially impact ‘effective giving and support for policies that reduce extreme poverty’. (We give a review of papers surveying this evidence below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA plain-language summary of key points, without references\n\n\n\n\n\nCharities’ impact differs by an order of magnitude: Some charities are much more effective at saving/improving lives (and achieving other goals such as those involving animals and the environment) than others are. While it is difficult to gain precise estimate on the measures such as “cost of a life saved” there is strong evidence that there are orders of magnitude difference between different categories of charities and different interventions within these categories.\nThere are some very effective lifesaving charities: Some interventions seem likely to save or vastly improve individual lives at a cost in the range of USD 2000 - USD 10,000. When people are asked whether they would be willing to spend this amount or even a vastly larger amount to save a life in other contexts they typically will agree to do so.\nThere are two related and largely unresolved puzzles:\n\nWhy are people not more generous with the most highly effective causes? and\nWhen they give to charity why do they not choose more effective charities?\n\nThere is some evidence on this but it is far from definitive. We do not expect there to be only a single answer to these questions; there may be a set of beliefs, biases, preferences, and underlying circumstances driving this. We would like to understand which of these are robustly supported by the evidence, and will have a sense of how important each of these are in terms of the magnitude of driving and absence of effective giving. There has been only a limited amount of research into this and it has not been systematic, coordinated, nor heavily funded.\nWe seek to understand because we believe that there is potential to change attitudes, beliefs, and actions (primarily charitable giving, but also political and voting behavior and workplace/career choices). Different charitable appeals, information interventions and approaches may substantially change peoples charity choices. We see potential for changing the “domain” of causes chosen (e.g., international versus US domestic) as well as the effectiveness of the charities chosen within these categories. (However, we have some disagreement over the relative potential for either of these.)\nOur main ‘policy’ audience includes both effective nonprofit organisations and ‘effective altruists’. The EA movement is highly-motivated, growing, and gaining funding. However, it represents a niche audience: the ‘hyper-analytic but morally-scrupulous’. EA organisations have focused on identifying effective causes and career paths, but have pursued neither extensive outreach nor ‘market research’ on a larger audience (see Charity Science, Gates Foundation/Ideas42).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Descriptives of giving (US, international) and how ‘ineffective’ it is.\n\nThis subsection section needs further work, outlining the existing evidence and basic ‘world in data’ picture for the questions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious references at IUPIU; see also Osili, Weipking, Bekkers work\nSources of data: PSID, GVUSA, GINPS, [add the list here], Giving USA: The Annual Report on Philanthropy (raw data?), Study of High Net Worth Philanthropy (but the latter is expensive to access)\n\n\n\n\nSome relevant questions and issues\nWho makes up ‘most of the giving’?

    "section": "2.3 Definitions - “Efficiency” versus impact",
    "text": "2.3 Definitions - “Efficiency” versus impact\n19\nIt is important to define the concept of talking about. What, precisely, is this ‘effectiveness’ or ‘impact’ of a charity we are focusing on? It is not trivial to get this right and there are some delicate and hotly debated questions even within the EA movement. Nonetheless, I sketch the basic idea in the math below.\nAside: ’but what about uncertainty?20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n* This discussion abstracts away from issues of empirical uncertainty. We obviously cannot be certain state of the world ‘with or without’ one’s charitable giving. This we cannot be certain about the impact of a particular charitable gift. I aim to return to this issue in later sections. Both empirical and ‘moral uncertainty’ have been carefully considered by academic philosophers and the EA community (e.g., at the Global Priorities Institute).\nFor the sake of the discussion below, we might assume that either:\n\ndonors essentially only care about the expected value consequences of their choices or\nto the extent that their is uncertainty over the ‘impact’ of donations and interventions, this uncertainty is similar across causes.\n\n\n\n\n\\(G_j\\): The total donations given to charity \\(j\\) during some interval; i.e., the charity’s income.\n\\(B_j(G_j)\\): A function defining the beneficial outcome achieved by charity \\(j\\) with the total donations \\(G_j\\).\nHere, we are referring to \\(B_j(G_j)\\) as (the improvement to) some ultimate outcome: Lives saved (i.e., deaths averted), quality adjusted life years (QALY) added, QALY weighted by age, Disease-adjusted (DALY), future happy lives generated, sentient suffering averted, etc.21\nThe important distinction here: \\(B(G_j)\\) does not refer to a simple intermediate ‘output’ such as ‘antimalarial nets provided’ nor ‘textbooks purchased’. We are referring to the social outcome of ultimate value; an outcome that could be valued in and of itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA value pluralist\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Schukraft:\n\nOf course, if you’re a value pluralist, there will be multiple outcome-types that are non-instrumentally valuable, and it’s unclear how to compare different types of non-instrumental values. (e.g., It’s tempting to say that people donating to art museums are engaged in ineffective giving, but if art has non-instrumental value, then it’s difficult to straightforwardly make this case).\n\nDavid Reinstein:\n\nPerhaps. I suppose that the empirical claims I make above probably do not apply to this measure over all domains.\n\n\n\n\nThis naturally takes into account both the ‘technical efficiency’ in terms of how many units of output can be produced per dollar, and the rate at which each unit of this output boosts the ultimate outcomes of interest.\n\n\n\nThe ‘production function’ is (perhaps tautologically) the product of two terms:\n(Total or marginal) impact per dollar = output per dollar \\(\\times\\) impact per output\n\n22\n\n\nA donor may care about the ‘impact’ of her own donation; i.e., she may want to know the difference in outcomes that her donation achieves everything else equal. In other words, the difference in the ultimate outcome in a world with versus without her donation.\nSmall donor assumption: For a small donor (perhaps someone who donates less than USD 100,000), we may assume that this “rate of benefit” will be the same for both the first and the last dollar she donates.23\n\nThus we consider the marginal impact, as a simplification:\n\\(B_j^\\prime (G_j)\\) for the marginal donor.\nI assert that \\(B_j^\\prime(G_j)\\) is the quantity that GiveWell (and perhaps other EA charity raters) are attempting to measure.\n\n\n\nWe know (evidence cited in fold):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is abundant evidence for order-of-magnitude difference in the effectiveness of charities, and the most popular ones are far from the most effective. Some further links and references:\nOrd, T. (2013, March 12). “The moral imperative toward cost-effectiveness in global health. Center for Global Development.” Retrieved from www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/142701.\n“Your dollar goes farther overseas” (Givewell, 2016).\n\n\n\n\\(B_j^\\prime(G_j)\\) is much larger for the most impactful relative to the most popular charities.\n\n\nIncreased benefits could be achieved if donations were “reallocated” towards more impactful charities. An individual who gains value from her giving through it’s impact alone would naturally donate to only the one charity that has the greatest marginal impact, the charity \\(j\\) with the greatest \\(B_j'(G_j)\\) term. If every donor is doing this, then as an ‘equilibrium’ result, every charity receiving positive donations should have the same last-dollar marginal impact. In maths:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\nB_k^\\prime(G_k) = B_j^\\prime(G_j)\\forall j,k s.t. G_j>0, G_k>0\n\\end{equation}\\]\nCaveats (unfold):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assumes a single impact goal, essentially ‘cause neutrality’.\nThe idea that each donor gives only to a single charity essentially depends on the above ‘Small donor assumption’. Still, allowing that the marginal-benefit-leading-charity may vary within the range of an individuals’ donation simply implies that they should allocate among multiple charities each up to the point that the last dollar given yields the same marginal benefit as the other charities, yielding the above result. We can imagine an equilibrium in which all donors give to multiple charities, with each of these charities being virtually “tied” in their marginal effectiveness.\nSee also this brief (EA Forum) on the “Market efficiency of philanthropy”. I hope to extend the discussion here, considering the ‘efficient market hypothesis’ applied to charitable donations, and the limitations of this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we do not seem to be doing this. Again: billions are given to charity, and these charities clearly have vastly different marginal impacts, even among those that seem to target very similar outcomes."

What could explain this?\nWe return to this in a later section, while classifying potential ‘barriers’ to effective giving.24\n\n2.4.1 Aside: Economic models of giving\n25\nTraditionally, economic models are essentially ‘if then’ exercises meant to illustrate what factors might be driving outcomes, perhaps facilitating empirical testing. They are not, in general, claims about people’s preferences, how they behave, or what motivates them. The discussion of charity in the Economics literature has tended to focus on two extreme models, focusing on modeling assumptions that allow simple mathematical ‘if-then’ proofs. Most of these models involve an individual making choices between a private good and a homogenous charitable good so as to maximizing a “utility function” (value function), subject to their budget constraints\n\nA adaptation of the ‘Public goods model’ (often attributed to Becker (1974)) in which individuals care about the total amount of a charitable good provided (no matter who contributes it), either because it benefits them directly or because they care about other people. (The utility of others might be subsumed into one’s own utility function). This is sometimes labeled (confusingly in my opinion) called “pure altruism”.\nAn extreme representation of a ‘Warm glow’ model (James Andreoni 1989) in which an individual’s utility increases (presumably at a decreasing rate) in the ’amount they sacrifice’ towards the charitable good.\n\nIt is also important to note that the ‘warm glow’ presented in the Economics literature does not map to only a single psychological mechanism or theory; it maps to many such mechanisms. There is some ambiguity as to which motivations should be subsumed in this ‘warm glow’. According to Andreoni (who coined the term):\n\nThe concept of warm-glow is only a convenient reduced-form representation for deeper and more complex considerations of givers (J. Andreoni 2006)\n\nIn fact, each of the above models is an extreme representation that was originally used to provide insight into how to think about issues such as “does government spending crowd-out private donations” and “how do individuals respond to tax-benefits for giving”? In its simplest form, each model yields predictions that are profoundly unrealistic and can easily be “rejected” by real world data.\nMuch is left ambiguous in each model, as well as in other fairly prominent models such as the “Impact” (Duncan 2004) or “Identification” (Atkinson 2009) models of giving, or reputation-based models (Harbaugh 1998)\n\n\nFor the present discussion, our focus, in considering these models, is:\n(When and how) does the “actual impact of one’s gift” have an impact\n\ninto the ‘good feeling’ one gets from giving\nor the thing the individual is maximizing\n\n… in a way that drives donation choices?\n\n\n\n\n\nAndreoni, J. 2006.

    "section": "3.1 Theoretical framework and concerns",
    "text": "3.1 Theoretical framework and concerns\nWhat does this question even mean? In a standard Economics framework we would consider joint optimization over “gifts to an ineffective charity” and “gifts to an effective charity”;* one doesn’t “respond” to the other.1\nPrices/ external changes shift each, but we can’t “force you to voluntarily give.” Furthermore, “prices” are unclear in this context (see Economics models of giving) and prices for one cause or charity rarely vary exogenously.\n\nIf we could shift the ‘meaningful giving’ \\(\\rightarrow\\) we could use theory of Conditional Demand (Pollak 1969) \\(\\rightarrow\\) “expenditure substitution” (D. A. Reinstein, n.d.). Still, the sign of the conditional demand effects are straightforward only under very restrictive conditions.\nWhat we can measure in a straightforward way (in principle), is :\n\nDoes a promotion for a less-effective charity (such as Cancer Research UK) cause more or less giving to a presumably more-effective charity (such as Doctors Without Borders)? Most of the work discussed below focuses on this sort of estimate.\n\n2\nBut this raises a more difficult question:\n\nIs the causality: Cancer Research UK (CRUK) promo \\(\\rightarrow\\) give more to CRUK \\(\\rightarrow\\) give less (more) to Oxfam? (see discussion in fold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Schukraft:\n\nt For a “seasoned donor” (ie, someone who consistently donates a fixed percentage of their income every year), it seems plausible that donating to A would reduce donations to B. But for a new donor, who has never or only sporadically donated in the past, learning about charity A might be the gateway to more regular donations in the future, which could increase giving to both A and B.\n\nDavid Reinstein: This is also plausible and something that has been posited. (Although it might be argued that the channel of “learning about charity A” should not be the included in this effect. Still, for most practical purposes, these are inseparable).\nSome of my own and others previous work loosely suggests that for the more occasional donors there is no real crowding out (or in). If I am a person who doesn’t feel constant internal pressure to give but only responds (e.g.) to temporary social pressure and in-my-face asks or the pull of my heart-strings in response to tragic events.\nMy sensitivity to these may be more or less unaffected by previously having donated.\n\n\n\n\nCan we rule out direct effects of the first promotion? (CRUK promo \\(\\rightarrow\\) donations to Oxfam; see (Heckman and Pinto 2015) on “mediators”)\n\nThis is directly relevant for a policymaker. She might face a ‘shock’ that she knows or expects will lead to donations to charity A to rise by EUR 1,000,000 EUR. She will want to know ‘how much can we expect donations to charity B to fall?’\n\nWhat underlying causes might lead the effect to go in one direction or the other?\nThe psychological ideas of “self-image management” and “moral-licensing” could also be expressed in terms of a utility function with particularly diminishing returns to total charitable giving; there may be a discount rate on the recency of the donation, as in a perishable good.\n\nAs previously noted, models from economics typically consider an individual maximizing her utility, including the utility she gets from her donations, directly or indirectly, quantified and formalized in terms of, e.g.,3\n\n“Public goods”: the total amount of ‘charity as a public good’ provided, no matter who provides it (sometimes referred to as ‘pure altruism’),\n“Warm glow”: the amount the donor herself has sacrificed (in some depictions, even if it does no good at all, or completely crowds out others’ donations! ( Andreoni (1989), as interpreted by and others),\nthe “Impact” a donor’s donation has on outcomes (Duncan 2004) (not taking into account the effect of her donation on other donors) or on particular identified beneficiaries, (Atkinson 2009) and (Tonin and Vlassopoulos 2010)\nthe donor’s prestige (Harbaugh 1998).\n\nBut see some critical notes on this in the fold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nI, David Reinstein, am strongly critical of the way ‘public goods’/warm-glow terminology and dichotomy. Models in Economics are often ‘if-then’ exercises. Both the warm-glow and the pure public goods model of donations (as well as a ‘mixed model that is additive in each of these) involve extreme simplifying assumptions used for insightful mathematical exercises. Neither should be seriously taken as serious empirical claims to fully represent the preferences of individual donors nor the population as a whole. Sugden (1982) and others have demonstrated why the public goods model can not meaningfully represent real-world charitable giving behavior.[ref] IN contradiction to the extreme presentation of the ’warm glow donor who only values her own sacrifice’, there has also been evidence that donors do care about where their donations go, responding, e.g., to the percieved deservingness of the recipient and to charitable ratings. This extreme model should have been seen prima facie as incredible – donors are not simply happy to throw their wealth into a garbage bin.\nThe term ‘warm glow’ is also confusing, and used inconsistently between the Economics and Psychology literatures. (E.g., in the latter, WG is often seen to encompass reputation concerns.)\nI discuss this further in an (unfinished) essay here.\n\n\n\nThese models do not explicitly differentiate between gifts to different charitable causes. Still, the models can be generalized to yield varying predictions for expenditure substitution, as discussed in D. A. Reinstein (n.d.).\nFrom an economics perspective, treating charitable giving like ‘any other good’ purchased by a donor (as a consumer), does not yield a clear prediction. Economists speak of goods being ‘complements and substitutes’, depending on how the price of one affects the number of units consumed of the other good. We can also consider how ‘expenditures on one good vary with shocks to expenditures on another’, referred to ‘expenditure substitution’ in D. A. Reinstein (n.d.). Here again, the prediction is ambiguous, but essentially it depends on the extent to which consumption of good (or charity) A satiates the desire for (diminishes the marginal utility of) good/charity B.^[(Scharf, Smith, and Ottoni-Wilhelm 2017) consider the intertemporal elasticity of a ‘warm glow’ component.]\n\nExpenditure substitution math\n4\nAssuming that utility is separable in own consumption and charitable gifts, and assuming an additive specific shock (\\(\\alpha\\)), we can express utility as: \\[U=f(x)+V(g_{1},g_{2}-\\alpha )\\] where the functions \\(V\\) and \\(f\\) are functions that represent utility from own-consumption and from charitable giving, repectively.\nThe budget constraint can be written as:\n\\[x+p_{1}g_{1}+p_{2}g_{2}\\leq Y\\] where \\(Y\\) represents total wealth, \\(p_{1}\\) and \\(p_{2}\\) are the prices of giving to charities one and two (per dollar the charity receives), and I normalize the price of own consumption to one.\nUnder this model, the marginal “indirect effect” of a shock (\\(\\frac{\\partial g_{1}}{\\partial \\alpha })\\) can be expressed simply as a function of the marginal “direct effect” of the shock (\\(\\frac{\\partial g_{2}}{\\partial \\alpha }\\)). Standard comparative statics of the optimal choices (assuming an interior solution and other standard regularity conditions) yields the total derivatives: \\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{dx}{d\\alpha } &=&\\frac{\\lambda _{\\alpha }}{U_{xx}} \\\\\n\\frac{dg_{1}}{d\\alpha } &=&\\frac{\\lambda _{\\alpha }(p_{2}U_{12}-p_{1}U_{22})%\n}{U_{12}^{2}-U_{11}U_{22}} \\\\\n\\frac{dg_{2}}{d\\alpha } &=&1+\\frac{\\lambda _{\\alpha\n}(p_{2}U_{11}-p_{1}U_{12})}{-U_{12}^{2}+U_{11}U_{22}}\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\lambda (\\alpha ,p_{1},p_{2})\\) is the shadow value of the budget constraint, \\(U_{IJ}\\) \\(\\equiv \\frac{\\partial ^{2}U}{\\partial I\\partial J}\\), \\(\\lambda _{\\alpha }\\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\lambda (\\alpha ,p_{1},p_{2})}{% \\partial \\alpha }\\).\nHence\n\\[\\frac{dg_{1}}{d\\alpha }=(\\frac{dg_{2}}{d\\alpha }-1)\\frac{%\np_{2}U_{12}-p_{1}U_{22}}{p_{1}U_{12}-p_{2}U_{11}}\\]\nThe sign of the marginal effect on \\(g_{1}\\) (relative to the marginal effect on \\(g_{1}\\)) can be either positive or negative, and will depend on the partial second derivatives of utility and the relative prices.\nLooking at the discrete effect: \\[g_{1}(\\alpha _{1})-g_{1}(\\alpha _{0})=\\int_{\\alpha _{0}}^{\\alpha _{1}}[(%\n\\frac{dg_{2}}{d\\alpha }(g_{1,}g_{2})-1)\\frac{%\np_{2}U_{12}(g_{1,}g_{2})-p_{1}U_{22}(g_{1,}g_{2})}{%\np_{1}U_{12}(g_{1,}g_{2})-p_{2}U_{11}(g_{1,}g_{2})}]d\\alpha\n\\label{integralgeneral}\\]\nWith quadratic utility (defined in fold), the partial derivatives will be constants,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(U(x_{0},x_{1},...,x_{n})=x_{0}+\\Sigma _{i=1}^{n}\\alpha _{i}x_{i}-(\\Sigma _{i=1}^{n}\\beta _{i}x_{i}^{2}+2\\Sigma _{i\\neq j}^{n}\\gamma _{ij}x_{i}x_{j})/2\\)\n\n\n\n… and the discrete indirect effect, as well as the marginal effect, will be a simple linear function of the direct effect:\n\\[g_{1}(\\alpha )=A+Bg_{2}(\\alpha )\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants.\nQuadratic utility is often justified as a second-order approximation to any other utility function. With other utility functions the partial derivatives may vary at different consumption bundles, so the indirect effect may be a nonlinear function of the direct effect, but these should be solvable for a predictable functional form, which for estimation purposes, can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a polynomial function. o"

    "text": "3.2 Previous approaches and evidence5\nObservation of this ‘crowding out’ is difficult. There is a lack of data on donations at the individual-charity level; available data typically considers total individual giving in a year (especially via tax records), asks people to recall their recent donations, sometimes broadly differentiated by cause but not by specific charity (see, e.g., Wilhelm (2006)). There is also data on charity’s total revenues (reported to the government as well as independent surveys), and data on giving through specific platforms. However, there is no source of data on an individual’s lifetime giving broken down across modes and specific charities.\nFor identification: Lack of independent observable variation in price, shocks, or appeals.\nIntertemporal substitution is an issue, and we typically cannot observe ‘lifetime giving.’\nEven defining this issue is a challenge, as noted above. Furthermore, estimation of ‘Expenditure substitution’ (D. A. Reinstein, n.d.) is complicated by issues of extensive vs intensive margins, as well as heterogeneity.\n\n3.2.1 Observational work\nObservational data typically lacks shocks that are clearly specific to giving to one charity. Observational data on charitable giving (e.g., survey data or tax data) offers few variables that can be used to identify ‘specific’ shocks – shocks that alter giving to one charity but have no independent effect on giving to other charities. Most observable variables that are believed to increase giving to one charity will also increase giving to other charities, masking substitution effects.\n\nSigning-the-bias approach\nD. A. Reinstein (n.d.) using PSID/COPPS data finds some evidence of expenditure substitution, especially for large givers.\nResults, “bounding below” argument:\n\nHe finds many negative significant correlations between residuals from fixed-effects regressions on donations to categories of charitable causes.\n\nThis especially holds for larger (prior) donors and for certain paired cause categories.\n\n\nUnder what he argues to be plausible econometric assumptions (essentially, net positive correlations between the residuals of ‘propensity to donate to each cause’) implies that negative correlations are strong evidence of expenditure substitution.\n\nInterpretation: He interprets these in terms of ‘heterogeneous motivations for giving’, arguing that large givers are more likely to have a sophisticated optimization over charities incorporating diminishing returns to each cause, and small givers more likely to be responding to temporary shocks and appeals.\n\n\nLimitations: Even if one accepts the bounding assumptions, t hese findings are limited, even as a bounded result. The data is recall data, and charitable categories are not well defined in the PSID data; respondents may categorize the same donations into different groupings.\n\n\nObservational data paired with ‘exogenous’ shocks\nDeryugina and Marx (2015):\n**Results and interpretation:\nDonations in a state affected by tornado increase 1.7-2 percent in that year and 1.9-2 percent in the 2 years after. The authors can only reject ‘full crowding out’.\n\n\nScharf, Smith, and Ottoni-Wilhelm (2017):\nThese authors observe “CAF accounts”; for this particular group, they observe all donations over a substantial period.\nAuthor’s conclusions:\n\nThey reject ‘full crowd-out’.

    "text": "4.2 “Practical breakdown (organizing this resource)\nMost of this bookdown is devoted to classifying potential barriers to effective giving and assessing the general and specific evidence for these barriers. We use a practical breakdown to organize this, particularly trying to avoid overlap between sections.\n\nFundamental values, moral circles, awareness, identity, and signaling\nA range of barriers could be considered in terms of the individual’s fundamental values, how she perceives the universe and her obligations to it, and her desire to project a positive image to herself and others.\n\n\nNon-utilitarian motivations: Before considering each ‘barrier to effective giving’, we first consider the case (and evidence, as far as this is possible) that donation choices may be fundamentally driven by factors other than a “universalist cause-neutral ‘desire to help others’.\n\n\nBarriers: “Distance”, awareness, and consideration, and consideration: People may tend to give more to a cause/charity that they are more aware of, that they feel is more important and salient, and that they feel close to. Some causes will be closer to the mass of potential donors than others; this can include physical closeness, cultural proximity, and more. As a result, other causes may be relatively neglected. This relates to “moral circle expansion” as well as quantitative biases such as the “availability heuristic”.\nLess proximate needs are less salient, thus they may be under-funded.\n\nPossible responses: Provide information or use other tools to enhance the social closeness of a recipient or beneficiary.\n\n\n\n@ref(identity): Barriers: Identity and cognitive dissonance\n\nWhen presented with information that contradicts their own views, an individual may feel that their identity is being threatened and become even more committed to their original beliefs. They may be concerned that giving up their initial position will negatively affect their reputation. In the case of effective giving, someone may be unwilling to give effectively as they would have to acknowledge that the money they were donating before was, indeed, ineffective.*\n\n* Source: paraphrase from EA forum (specify, potentially replace with a more authoritative source)\n\n\n\nSignaling and social pressures/social identity\nConsidering effectiveness in giving (and publicizing this concern) may conflict with an individual’s self-perception. It may also harm her reputation, at least relative to emotional or ‘deontological’ helping responses.\n\n-   social obligations to give locally (and 'crowding out'/moral licencing) (see, e.g., @meerBrotherCanYou2011)\n\nDoes one contribution crowd out another? If so, social pressure, systems enforcing 'local public goods' and inertial factors may limit effective (non-local) giving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness information: Avoidance, motivated reasoning, conflicts between analytic and empathetic modes\nEven if people want to give effectively (and are not parochial, have wide moral circles, etc)…\n… for people to give effectively they need to know which charities are effective.*\n\n*For this to be the case, charities must transparently submit to rigorous metrics. Charities must advertise their impact and compete on this basis. For charities to want to do this, they must believe that donors as ‘consumers’ care about this.\nAccording to Mulesky (2020) “Charities routinely appeal to impact when soliciting donations”; However, the example she gives is not a clear measure of per dollar impact.\nHowever, a feature of philanthropy overlooked in published research is that nonprofit organizations rarely support these claims with rigorous evidence.\n\nEvaluation-aversion and obstacles to considering charity impact\nPeople may dislike doing this ‘cost-benefit evaluation’ in the context of charities, or may feel it is not appropriate. They may thus avoid doing it (see ‘Cost-benefit analysis aversion’)\n\n\nEffect of analytical (effectiveness) information on generosity\nFurthermore, doing, and being exposed to such evaluations may ‘switch off’ their empathy, or enable ‘motivated reasoning’ in considering this information, giving them ‘excuses’ to be less generous.\nIn a more general sense, it may be that emotion overrides cognition.\n\n\n\n\nJudgement/cognition failures, systematic misperceptions\nBarriers: Quantitative biases: Biases in perceiving impact and in making choices\nPeople may (at least to some extent) want to be effective in their donation. However, they may simply not be good at doing this. Quantitative biases may drive departures from effectiveness in general. Anything that causes me to misunderstand effectiveness, to misapprehend the nature of the “production function for good outcomes”, or to misjudge charities will lead me astray from effective giving. If I am making any mistake, I am failing to optimize. Furthermore, some biases may happen to be particularly harmful to those charities and causes that are most effective.\n\nCognitive biases include: Overweighting and underweighting probabilities, Misunderstanding marginality, Scope-insensitivity, Opportunity-cost Neglect, Identifiable victims effect, and Overhead aversion\n\nBarriers: Persistent and systematic incorrect empirical beliefs\nIn the absence of cost-effectiveness information, people may be systematically misinformed about which charities, interventions, and approaches are effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on previous sections (Are Charities in Competition, Inertia) (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a previous sections we presented a long discussion of the evidence and theory on whether ‘one contribution comes at the expense of another’,\nIn an appendix chapter we give a short (and incomplete/WIP) discussion of the issue of ‘inertia’, and whether slow changes in social norms and individual behavior are inhibiting effective giving.\nWe do not present these explicitly as ‘barriers’. To us, these seem like underlying factors that will interact with these barriers and make some things more or less salient. The nature of the evidence is also somewhat distinct. However, this is very much a judgement call, and we could have gone either way. It was also a judgement call to put the discussion of underlying (non)-utilitarian values in the ‘barriers’ section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaviola, Lucius, Stefan Schubert, and Joshua D.

    "section": "5.1 Are people utilitarian?",
    "text": "5.1 Are people utilitarian?\nFundamentally, our base values may be non-utilitarian. A universalist cause-neutral ‘desire to help others’ might not be what drives most giving.\nMost of our discussion largely assumes that an individual is, at least to some extent:\n\nOther-regarding/pro-social: Her preferences or the “utility function she is maximizing” incorporates the well-being of others, at least to some extent\nA moral utilitarian (or otherwise consequentialist; but see fold below): The value she places on helping others (or on others’ outcomes) is principally increasing in some measure of the amount of good they have done for others, or in others’ welfare. For a given personal sacrifice, she will always prefer to have made more people more well-off than to have made fewer people less well-off. In Economics terms, she strictly prefers and values Pareto-improvements.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-consequentialists still care about consequences …?\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Schukraft:\n\nNon-consequentialists still care about the consequences of their actions (they just think other things matter, too). As far as I can tell, effective giving is required by every plausible moral theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent-neutral (‘universalist’): In considering others’ welfare, she values all others equally regardless of their identity. (Unfold for a precise example of this.)2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent-neutrality: a more precise example:\nConsider a world with three other people (B,C,D). Suppose each begin in a poor state. Consider outcomes such as:\n\nB and C are well off and D is poor\nD is well-off and B and C are poor\n\nA universalist, as I define it, would always prefer outcome 1 over outcome 2. She would also rather achieve outcome 1 over outcome 2 with her charity, no matter the identity of persons B, C, and D.\n\n\n\n\nNot ‘deontological’: She faces no other relevant absolute moral constraints (constraints such as ‘do no harm in your actions, even if others are helped’)\n\n\n\nTo what extent does a ‘moral utilitarian’ (MU) consequentialist ethic govern beliefs and behaviour? To the extent it does, limited effective giving represents a puzzling intention/action gap.\nHowever, for non-utilitarians this is no puzzle. If other forces and motivations drive our giving choices, we might not expect these to be aligned with effectiveness.\nIt could be argued that the above is posed too starkly. People may embrace concepts such as utilitarianism, universalism, and cause neutrality, and at the same time be largely driven by other concerns and sympathetic to other moral frameworks. We may agree with statements that “all lives are equal” and “we should strive to do the most good for the largest number” but also support maxims such as “charity begins at home” and “giving is about supporting something you have a personal connection to.”3\n\nPerhaps moral utilitarianism (MU) is relatively unimportant in most people’s charitable choices. Even if this is the case, understanding the ways in which people do pursue their giving goals—and their obstacles and “biases” in doing so—may suggest ways of making giving more impactful. For example, many donors may prioritize their local community, leading to their less-effective giving (from a universalist point of view). However, they might be persuaded to expand their definition of their own ‘community’, or more generally, expand their “moral circle” (discussed in (Crimston et al. 2018)).\n\n\n\n\nExamples of concerns (other than Moral Utilitarianism) that might drive giving/charity-choices:\n\nPerfectionism/deontological aversion to ‘waste’\nSocial pressure\nSignaling virtue to others\nEmotional empathic reactions to particular images and situations\nA desire to identify with particular causes or particular groups of individuals, perhaps in opposition to other groups\nReligious motivations\nFairness concerns"

All but one of GiveWell’s top charities support people in sub-Saharan Africa (“Top Charities” n.d.).2 Moreover, people in wealthy developed countries are more likely to be in a position to give a significant amount (Macaskill 2015). However, the large cultural and physical distance between those in developed countries and those in developing countries may be an important barrier to giving and a reason why people prefer to give locally.\nSimilar issues of ‘distance’ also applies to other causes with strong arguments for being effective and impactful (see, e.g., ‘EA funds’ recommendations), particularly supporting (farmed and wild) animal welfare and the preserving the long-term future of humanity. Most potential donors do not see inside of factory farms3 and obviously no one can visit the far-future."

    "text": "6.4 Distance - Spatial/Physical, Social/Cultural: parochial altruism/in-group bias, interpersonal and identity e.g., race, gender, age, etc\n\nConsider:\n\nWhat is the evidence that we are less empathetic or less generous to those far from us along these margins?\nWhat is the evidence that this is manifested in our actions and choices (political, professional, etc)?\nWhat is the evidence that this is manifested in our charitable giving?\n\nParochialism may pose a significant barrier to effective giving. Parochialism, as defined by Baron and Szymanska (2011) is the mental process of making a distinction between in-groups and out-groups, where people feel a greater connection with their own groups and weigh their welfare more heavily.\nThere is some evidence for this in charitable contexts. In a laboratory experiment, Chen and Li (2009) found that when matched with an in-group member, people were significantly more likely to show charitable concern, shown through their allocation of tokens. Sudhir, Roy, and Cherian (2016) suggest that categorizing others as in-group members (along lines such as race, gender and age) increases the sense of responsibility and level of emotion felt, resulting in higher levels of sympathy and consequently a stronger urge to help. They examined this effect by randomizing advertising content in a large scale experiment with charitable mailings in India. When the woman on a flyer advertising the charity in question was from the in-group (in this case a Hindu woman in India, compared to a Christian woman in the out-group), they found a higher rate of donation and greater amounts raised. They suggest that the charity “more than doubles donation dollars by recognizing the identified victim sympathy bias in making its appeals”.\n\n\nOther potentially relevant work:\nKogut et al 2018:\n\nAbstract: In the present research, we examined how the prospective donorâ’s psychological distance from a given victim may interact with the victim’s identification to determine the donor’s willingness to accede to requests for donations to help the victim in question. In three studies, we measured willingness to donate (Studies 1 and 2) and actual donations (Study 3) to identified or unidentified victims, while measuring (Study 1) or manipulating (Studies 2 and 3) the psychological distance between prospective donors and the recipients. Results indicate that increasing the psychological distance between prospective donors and victims decreases willingness to help but only when the victims are unidentified, not when they are identified. This suggests that victim’s identification mitigates the effect of distance on donor’s willingness to help.\n\nK.F. Law, D. Campbell, B. Gaesser: Biased benevolence: The perceived morality of effective altruism across social distance\n\nAcross four studies, the authors demonstrate that donating money to socially distant others (where donations usually have the largest impact) is perceived as less morally acceptable. Actors who helped a distant stranger rather than socially closer others (e.g., family or friends) were also judged more negatively and trusted less in an economic game."

    "text": "6.5 Distance: Experiential, Informational, Emotional/Affective7\nExperiential distance describes one’s proximity to a particular situation or feeling as a result of having seen something or been a part of it. In particular, a greater experiential distance is seen to make it more difficult to imagine a particular situation or feeling, therefore making it harder to empathize with someone going through it. This could create a barrier to giving effectively as most charitable giving is motivated by empathy and sympathy for victims (Lowenstein & Small, 2007). Experiential distance explains why it is easier for an individual to feel empathy for a victim if they have personally experienced the ailment or someone close to them has. As a result, they do not have to imagine the suffering it may have caused because they have directly or indirectly physically experienced it. In other words, the experiential gap is smaller. For example, people living in wealthy nations are more likely to be affected by cancer than malaria, leading to a greater support for that cause.\nThis could reflect a form of availability bias, specifically availability-by-recall. This is defined by Pachur et al., (2012): “Recall instances of Risk A and Risk B, respectively, from your social network (encompassing family, friends, and acquaintances), and infer that risk to be more prevalent in the population for which more such instances can be recalled.” An example of this is presented in the study by Lichenstein et al., (1978). They found that participants in their study were more likely to believe that an illness was more deadly if someone they knew (indirect suffering) or they themselves (direct suffering) had experienced the illness."

    "text": "6.7 Availability heuristic and media (also see ‘biases’)\nRare events such as natural disasters are particularly vivid and salient, and the availability bias suggests that people will overestimate the probability and value of events if they come to mind more easily (Amos Tversky and Kahneman 1973). For example, people might overestimate the probability of airplane crashes due to their salience.\nLoewenstein and Small (2007) argue that vividness is also one of the key determinants of sympathy, and one of the most important demonstrations of this is the identifiable victim effect. Their research suggests that victims who are ‘determined’ received higher levels of aid compared with indeterminate victims, as without identifying them people struggle to empathise, and are as a result less likely to help (Small and Loewenstein 2003).8\n\nEpstein (2006) concluded that natural disasters received a level of donations that was significantly out of proportion to the damage the disasters caused, while other long-term, persistent problems such as AIDS and malaria got much less attention, and consequently much less funding. For example, he discusses the difference in donation rates at the time (2006) between victims of Hurricane Katrina and victims of AIDS, with private donors giving 1,839 dollars per person to those affected by Katrina, and only 10 dollars per person diagnosed with AIDS. He also argued that the huge donations to causes like Hurricane Katrina had the effect of significantly reducing donations to some other charities, although this idea of ‘expenditure substitution’ is hard to measure and is still largely unresolved. See previous section (’Are characteristic in competition)\nEven when it comes to relief from the government, Eisensee and Stromberg (2007) suggest that the level of U.S. relief for natural disasters depended on whether the disaster had happened while other widely covered events were also occurring.\nUsing data on natural disasters from the Emergency Disaster Database (EM-DAT), and disaster responses from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), they explored the relationship between news coverage and relief for natural disasters. To examine whether news had a causal effect on relief, they used two instrumental variables. These variables served the purpose of constructing “meaningful and operational measures of the availability of newsworthy material”. First, they used ‘news pressure’, by measuring the median number of minutes news broadcasts devoted to the top three news stories of the day. Secondly, they used the Olympics, chosen as a large media event that isn’t directly related to politics.\nThey concluded that U.S. disaster relief decisions were dependent on “the availability of other newsworthy material at the time of the disaster”. Their explanation of this effect is that “relief decisions are driven by news coverage of disasters and that this news coverage is crowded out by other newsworthy material”. This potentially poses an issue for effective giving, as the authors suggest that the levels of relief shouldn’t be driven by factors that are not related to the effectiveness of the relief.[They use a very interesting methodology; we might describe it a bit more.][(Are there similar results for charitable giving?)]"

    "text": "6.8 Reference dependence\nThe issue of the arguably disproportionate attention that natural disasters receive has been previously explored. Epstein (2006) discusses the high levels of support that natural disasters get. He drew on the work of Spence (2006), who reported that there was little relationship between the degree of need and the level of donations. This was illustrated by the private donations (at the time - 2006) of USD 1839 per person impacted by Hurricane Katrina, and USD 10 per person impacted by AIDS. Small (2010) posed potential questions that this might raise:\n\nAlthough the response to dramatic events showcases a great human capacity for caring, the relative neglect of ongoing suffering reveals an equal albeit less attractive capacity for indifference. Can we make sense of this duality? Why do chronic conditions fail to move us even though they do so much harm?\n\nSudhir, Roy, and Cherian (2016) and Small (2010) have both suggested that reference dependence could provide an explanation for this issue, drawing on the work of Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Reference dependence is the notion that people don’t value absolute amounts, but instead view gains and losses relative to a reference point (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; A. Tversky and Kahneman 1991).\nStudies from Small (2010) analyze this effect beyond the utility of the individual, evaluating reference dependence in the context of others’ utility. She predicts that because sympathy could be based on change, rather than on a state, then people who have experienced a loss will induce greater levels of sympathy than those who have chronic issues. Small (2010) summarizes the move from analyzing reference dependence for one’s own self, to analyzing reference dependence when viewing the circumstances of others, as follows:\n\nAlthough the reference dependence modeled in prospect theory was conceived to explain the value of outcomes for the self, this research suggests that feelings and behavior with respect to the outcomes of others similarly responds to changes in welfare, not just absolute states. The studies provide insight into how the hardships of others appeal to our emotions. Bearing reference dependence in mind, the government, media and humanitarian agencies can better appeal to sympathy by shifting the focus of attention away from stats of need and instead to losses relative to a reference point.\n\nShe also suggests that the high levels of sympathy and donations seen with natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, and the relative lack of sympathy for AIDS and malaria, are consistent with this idea.\nThe first study from Small (2010) examined whether people feel more sympathy for those who have had a negative change, by asking participants to rate their sympathy for people with health conditions that were described as either chronic or recent onset. She found that sympathy was significantly greater in the loss victims than the constant state victims, which she argued was the first evidence that sympathy may be greater in cases that involve a clear loss than for equivalent cases that involve a chronic misfortune.\nHer second study examined how this idea translated from emotion into actual decision making, using a dictator game. It found that allocators in the dictator game gave more money, and felt greater sympathy, to recipients who had recently lost than to those recipients who stayed constant. This led her to conclude that “prosocial behaviour is not simply a function of others’ states, but additionally responds to whether that state is chronic or changed”.\nIn a study from Sudhir, Roy, and Cherian (2016), where they randomized charitable marketing content (described above), they also found evidence for sympathy being driven by reference dependency. They found that when victims were labelled as currently destitute, having been well-off before, this generated 50% more donors, and average donations per mailing increased by 33%. This is relative to advertisements depicting someone also described as destitute, but with an undescribed past. They concluded that this supported their hypothesis that those in chronic poverty are likely to get less sympathy than those who have suffered a change.\nThese reference dependence effects may only be significant when the target is an identified victim. In another study from Small (2010), she examined whether the affective quality of the victim moderates the reference dependence effect. She found, consistent with her other studies, that identified loss victims elicited more sympathy than identified constant-state victims. However, when this effect was examined with statistical victims, the effect was reversed, with the constant state victims getting more sympathy than the loss victims. Small suggests that this could be because when judgements are less emotion-based, as in the evaluation of statistical victims, people are more likely to account for the duration of the hardship. She evaluated the significance of this result as follows:\n\n“This finding lends support to the key theoretical claim that reference-dependent aid judgements are driven by emotion-based thought; when the victim description is unemotional, the effect does not persist”9"

    "text": "6.9 Distance - Temporal (future problems/individuals) and Hypothetical (probability of occurance)\n10\n\nOverview\nWhen considering how we can reduce suffering through effective altruism, immediate problems such as hunger and poverty are clearly visible. However, as well as the sentient beings alive today, altruists may consider challenges that can impact the welfare of future individuals as well. Benjamin Todd outlines this in his article on ‘longtermism’ (worth reading for a more in-depth discussion of the issue) as follows:\n\nSince the future is big, there could be far more people in the future than in the present generation. This means that if you want to help people in general, your key concern shouldn’t be to help the present generation, but to ensure that the future goes well in the long-term… This thesis is often confused with the claim that we shouldn’t do anything to help people in the present generation. But the long-term value thesis is about what most matters - what should do about it is a further question. It might turn out that the best way to help those in the future is to improve the lives of people in the present, such as through providing health and education. The difference is that the major reason to help those in the present is to improve the long-term”\n\nThis consideration of future people and future problems includes well-known issues such as climate change. It also includes less-discussed) lower-probability or more distant events such as nuclear war, bioterrorism and AI related issues (Macaskill 2015). Individuals such as Ord (2020) and institutions like the Future of Humanity Institute have argued that these problems are important and neglected.\nHowever, even motivating ‘giving for current issues’ presents many challenges; encouraging giving for (e.g.) ‘individuals who are yet to be’ born could prove even more difficult.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther resources and discussion\n\n\n\n\n\nSee 80000 hours podcast with Toby Ord and the articles and books linked (especially ‘The Precipice’) for a more comprehensive introduction to the long-term future.\nSee also these resources from effectivealtruism.org, see here for a talk on the importance of future generations, and here for an overview of the long-run future as an issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscounting future payoffs/assets/welfare\nConsidering how heavily we should weigh the future is a subject that has been raised frequently in the field of Economics (perhaps most notably climate economics in recent times), leading us to the idea (and various conceptions) of ‘discount rates’ (Ackerman 2008). Greaves (2017) outlines how discount rates can work as follows (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have an opportunity to undertake an investment project, sacrificing k < 1 units of consumption today in order to secure an increase of 1 unit in consumption a time interval t later. Our basic question is: what is the threshold value of k at which the status quo becomes socially preferable to such a sacrifice? The answer to this question is the social discount factor for consumption at time t, R(t). (One also has a private discount factor, corresponding to private as opposed to social preferences; in the remainder of this article, the focus is on the social version.) One generally expects R to decline with time — we are willing to sacrifice more today to gain an increase in one unit of consumption tomorrow than to gain an increase of one unit of consumption next year. The decline, however, may be faster or slower, and for current purposes the rate of the decline is crucial.\n\n\nThe choice of discount rate is crucial in the evaluation of projects some of whose important effects are long-term. Analyses that use a higher discount rate will tend to favour the short term: projects requiring sacrifices in the short term for the sake of benefits in the further future will be more likely to fail cost-benefit tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nAn informal discussion from David Reinstein (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn considering whether there is a bias against helping people in the future we need to establish a baseline: At what rate (if at all) should an effective altruist weigh (far) future lives/pleasure/suffering as less-valuable as current or near-future lives? At what rate should we ‘discount’, if at all?\n\n\nI think it’s actually not clear that we, as a society, should be discounting at all, either for consumption itself, or for some conception of ‘happiness’ or ‘utility’ (where here I’m thinking of ‘utility’ as something that does express well-being, not the very abstract economic concept of ‘the thing that we maximize’).\n\n\nIndividuals might discount future “pleasure”:\n\nbecause they might not survive to the future (although this should enter in as a ‘survival discount’ tied to the probability of surviving)\nbecause they are impatient (but this is potentially not in their own interest)\n\n\n\nIndividuals may discount future ‘income’ (in currency, inflation-adjusted) or ‘physical consumption’\n\nIf we think the ‘future me’ will be wealthier than the present me (consumption smoothing)\nOr if we think I will be less sensitive to pleasure/pain\n\n\n\nBusinesses/investors may discount future earnings (again, inflation adjusted)\n\nIf they think that there are other opportunities for ‘returns above inflation’ … because ‘returns to capital exceeds the rental cost of capital’\n\nThis should be true for growing societies as well, i.e., where there is real-GDP/capita growth (I’m being a bit loose here)\n\n\nThis is not the same as discounting future utility or welfare. There’s no clear reason we should do this.\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons the distant future may be neglected\nBeyond the technical analysis of “at what rates people might discount the future”, Schubert (2020) outlines a few reasons why the distant future may receive less attention and action.13\nHe argues:\n\nPresent issues are likely more salient than future issues, and because these issues are more salient, they will be discussed more.\nUncertainty is likely an important factor. Even if you are concerned with future well-being, if it is unclear how you can impact the distant future, you may be more likely to focus on other issues.\nLack-of-polarisation: “When there is no political conflict, a question might get less discussed, even if it’s seen as morally important”.\n\nWhile uncertainty could pose a problem for encouraging giving for distant future causes in particular, factoring in uncertainty is not necessarily a bias. It may be a reasonable choice, and there is further discussion of uncertainty and how this may link to a form of risk-aversion (see here).\nThe other barriers in this section also link to a potential lack of future-focused giving. For example, when it comes to the availability bias, we suggested that vividness and salience of events may influence how people estimate probabilities. Future events may be hard to picture, particularly more abstract risks like the dangers of artificial intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what is the ‘distant future’?\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Schukraft:\n\nWhenever longtermism is the subject, I always prefer to be specific about times. Some people reasonably consider 2070 to be “the distant future.” Other people would reserve the term for dates 10,000 years in the future or later. The former is obviously much less neglected than the latter.\n\n\n\n\nWe also discussed the identifiable victim effect. It could be significantly harder to create a story around a single victim if victims affected by that issue do not yet exist. Victims in the distant future may have to be statistical victims only, potentially eliciting less sympathy and consequently less donations. Charities that focus on the distant future may also have issues demonstrating evidence of their impact to donors, which can help to encourage donations (Karlan and Wood, 2017). However, the influence of demonstrating impact is mixed, as we further discuss here.\n\nThe impact of people being categorised into in-groups and out-groups could also be considered in analysing potential donations to distant-future causes. In their review of the literature, Sudhir, Roy, and Cherian (2016) suggest social identity works as follows:\n\nSocial identity has three major components: categorization, identification and comparison. Categorization is the process of putting people, including ourselves, into categories; for example, labelling a person as Chinese, black, female, or a lawyer are all different ways of categorization. Categorization also defines our self-image. Identification is the process by which we associate or identify ourselves with certain groups. We identify with in-groups, and we do not identify with out-groups. Finally, comparison is the process by which we compare in-groups with out-groups, creating a favourable bias toward the in-group. Overall, categorization of others as belonging to an in-group arouses feelings of greater closeness and responsibility and augments emotional response to their misfortune through greater sympathy (Brewer and Gardner (1996), Dovidio et al. (1997)) and willingness to help (Dovidio (1984), Dovidio et al. (1997)).\n\nDistant-future generations might be mentally placed in their own category (considered separated from near-future and present generations). This categorical distance could mean that people identify with distant-future generations less. If they are seen as an out-group, this could pose a barrier for giving to distant future generations.14\n\n\n(Evidence … work in progress)\n\nWhat is the evidence that they are actually doing this (taking into account the ‘uncertainty’ issue (we know less about how to help the far-future).\nWhat factors drive this bias or mitigate it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAckerman, Frank. 2008. “Climate Economics in Four Easy Pieces.” Development 51 (3): 325331.\n\n\nBaron, Jonathan, and Ewa Szymanska. 2011. “Heuristics and Biases in Charity.”\n\n\nBrewer, Marilynn B, and Wendi Gardner. 1996. “Who Is This\" We\"?

    "section": "8.2 Theory and argument",
    "text": "8.2 Theory and argument\nSimler and Hanson (2017) argue that social signaling is a major driver of human behavior, particularly in the charitable domain. Essentially, we may make choices that we would not have otherwise made in order to boost our reputation among our peers, colleagues, etc.. Reputation may be valued for its own sake or instrumentally, as a means to inducing others to act more favorably to us. Game theory (see esp. (Spence 1973)) offers a precise conception of this signaling as a costly way to demonstrate one’s positive “type” in a context with asymmetric information.\nSeveral authors (can be interpreted to) suggest that valuing ‘’effectiveness in generosity’‘, i.e., moral-utilitarianism, is seen as a negative signal by peers and lowers fitness in the cooperation market, at least in comparison to signaling other empathic pro-social responses, perhaps involving a ’virtue ethic’. The exchange below captures the basic argument… (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Robin Hanson and Rob Wiblin exchange on 80000 hours podcast; see Chapter 12 of “The Elephant in the Brain” (Hanson)\n\nHanson: But of course people spend a lot of time directly helping even when they’re relatively well-paid and they could pay other people who earn much lower wages to do a lot more.\n\n\nWiblin: This is the example of the high-flying lawyer dishing out soup in a soup kitchen.\n\n\nHanson: … the alternative theory that we suggest is that you are trying to show that you feel empathy. That is you want to show there is an emotional capacity in you such that if you see someone around you in need you will feel like you want to do something about that. And existing charities do tend to successful show that. They show somebody who needs help in a direct way that invokes your emotions and you do help to some degree, you do the thing that people would say would help and that shows people around you that you’re not an uncaring person and it might show them, for example, that if they were in need of help later and they were near you you would see them and you would feel about them too. You want to show people that you will be useful ally. If either of you is in trouble the other will come to their aid.\n\n\nWiblin: So why is it more important to show the people that you’re the kind of person who if they someone in pain that they’re going to try to help them right then and there than to show that you’re the kind of person who’s smart enough to think about which charities are useful and does their research and actually tries to help people? Because if you don’t care about whether charities are effective or not, my thoughts would just be that you’re not really going to pay attention to whether you’re actually helping your friends or not?\n\nHanson: Right, but at least if I want your help and I’m your friend it will be my job to put myself in your face and to tell you about my problem. And maybe I figure I coul successfully get myself in front of your face and make you pay attention to my problem and help you understand what I think is effective and then you would just do what I say, and that’s maybe what I’m mostly hoping for. And if you were this person who thinks carefully about how to help the best person in the world who needs help, well I’m plausibly not going to be that best person in the world who needs help so I’m not going to win out in that contest so it’s not actually going to be that useful to know you as the sort of person who will help the person in the world who needs the most help.\n\n\n\n(J. A. Everett, Pizarro, and Crockett 2016) argue that deontological ethics signal stable cooperative behavior to others, which enhances fitness in mutualistic partner choice models.1 The basic argument is “An individual who claims [and believes] that stealing is always morally wrong … seems much less likely to steal from me than an individual who believes that the stealing is sometimes morally acceptable depending on the consequences.”\nBackground and further discussion … in fold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors’ motivation is to explore why “intuitive moral judgments often”share characteristics with deontological theories while “consequentialist judgments are often the result of slow, deliberative cognitive processes”. Their key theoretical argument cites “mutualistic partner choice models of the evolution of morality”, which…\n\nposit a cooperation market such that agents who can be relied upon to act in a mutually beneficial way are more likely to be chosen as cooperation partners, thus increasing their own fitness\n\n\nthe typical deontological reason for why specific actions are wrong is that they violate duties to respect persons and honor social obligations-features that are crucial when selecting a social partner. An individual who claims that stealing is always morally wrong and believes themselves morally obligated to act in accordance with this duty seems much less likely to steal from me than an individual who believes that the stealing is sometimes morally acceptable depending on the consequences. Actors who express characteristically deontological judgments may therefore be preferred to those expressing consequentialist judgments because these judgments may be more reliable indicators of stable cooperative behavior.\n\n\nAnd recent theoretical work has demonstrated that -“cooperating without looking”—that is, without considering the costs and benefits of cooperation—is a subgame perfect equilibrium (Hoffman, Yoeli, and Nowak 2015). Therefore, expressing characteristically deontological judgments could constitute a behavior that enhances individual fitness in a cooperation market because these judgments are seen as reliable indicators of a specific valued behavior-cooperation.\n\n\n\n\nHoffman, Yoeli, and Nowak (2015) present an evolutionary game theoretic analysis of an indefinitely repeated game where2\n\nPlayer 1 can publicly ‘look’ to see the cost of cooperation,\nPlayer 1 next chooses to cooperate or defect, and then\nPlayer 2 chooses whether to continue repeating the above game, or end the relationship.\n\nThey provide conditions under which ‘cooperating without looking’ (CWOL) is part of a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, and an evolutionarily stable equilibrium can involve a substantial rate of CWOL play.\nHowever, the analogy to effective versus ineffective giving is not clear. Perhaps a connection could be made if considering the charity effectiveness tended to provide a motivation to give less, but this is not obviously the case. In general, an ‘excuse not to do something’ is not the same as a ‘choice to be effective’."

Everett, Pizarro, and Crockett (2016) ran a series of experiments on the Mturk platform, involving hypothetical dilemmas paired with low-stakes (or no) Trust games.\nIn each, participants were asked to make and justify their judgement in a moral dilemma such as the famous ‘trolley dillemma’. In each case, this was a (hypothetical) choice between inaction and taking an action that sacrifices a small number of lives to save a larger number of lives.3\n\nWe then had our participants rate the morality and trustworthiness of each agent on a scale (Study 1a), play a hypothetical trust game (TG) with the agents (Study 1b), and, finally, play a TG involving real monetary stakes with the agents (Study\n\nAcross several studies deontologist agents were preferred in partner choices by participants endorsing the same values; even moral-utilitarians seem to favor peers who express emotional empathy and deontological ethics (ibid., p. 45).\nHowever, this difference was not present in the track-switching dilemma, the only dilemma in which a majority favored the consequentialist choice.\nIncorporate some of the other papers mentioned in the Gdoc here\n\n\nMontealegre et al. (2020) Does Maximizing Good Make People Look Bad? Manuscript\nType of evidence: Online experiment (M-turk) with hypothetical choices (attitudes), six pre-registered studies using two different scenarios (N = 1,961)\nRelation to charitable giving: directly, since …\nScenarios (including within and between subjects approaches):\n\nparticipants evaluate a response to survey question about how to select a charity (“If you were to donate, how would you select which charity to donate to?”).\n\n\nDeliberative: I would use evidence to calculate which charity spends its donations most cost effectively, and donate to them.\n\n\nEmpathic: I would try to put myself in the shoes of people who are going through difficult situations, and donate to a charity that helped them.\n\n\nJohn was approached by a charity fundraiser and was asked whether he would be interested in donating to help Rokia, a 7-year-old girl from Mali, Africa who was desperately poor and faced the threat of severe hunger or even starvation. The charity fundraiser showed John a picture of Rokia (also presented to participants) and then asked John whether he would be interested in supporting her.\n\nAcross conditions, participants were presented with the general scenario and only the potential donor’s actions differed depending on the condition:\nDeliberation: “John thought that donating to help Rokia might not be the most cost-effective way to use his money and that maybe he should donate to a charity doing something more cost-effective instead. He asked the charity fundraiser about the relevant statistics of the program and since the data suggested this charity was the most cost-effective John donated to the charity.”\nEmpathy: “John was deeply moved by Rokia’s situation and about how terrible her situation must be for her. After hearing about her tragic story and imagining how his donation could help her John donated to the charity.”\nRobustness checks for: gender, stake size\nBackground mechanism: donors’ failure to prioritize cost-effectiveness can be explained by signaling concerns, since people who favor deontological over consequentialist decisions are preferred as social partners (J. A. C. Everett, Pizarro, and Crockett 2016)\nKey findings: Across six studies, donors who deliberated were perceived as having worse moral character, were rated as less desirable as social partners, and were judged to be less guided by moral motives. On the other hand, those who deliberated were also seen as more reasonable and competent, and were judged to be more guided by pragmatic motives. Thus, there may be reputational benefits associated with deliberating. However, since deliberators are less preferred as social partners the authors believe the overall effect one reputation is negative. They do not find any differences in trustworthiness. Exhibiting empathy before deliberating reduced most negative reputational effects. People how do not give at all are seen as the worst. Surprisingly, participants judge the empathy donors as more wasteful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nA critique (Jason Schukraft):\n\nThis set-up seems misleading to me because in the first case it appears to be left uncertain whether John would donate to a different (more effective) charity if the data didn’t pan out.\n\n\nIt also might imply a false dichotomy: in the first case, readers might imagine that John doesn’t experience an empathetic response? In my view, EA is successful because it combines empathy with deliberation. I would be very suspicious of an EA who wasn’t empathetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurum et al, ’20\n(Burum, Nowak, and Hoffman 2020)\nInvolving variation in donation multipliers and social signaling/rewards4\n\n\nAlso\n\nYudkin et al, 2019, “Actions speak louder than outcomes in judgments of prosocial behavior”\nJohnson https://psyarxiv.com/r85jv/ … Mturk experiments, people asked about praiseworthiness of hypothetical donors, between subject variation in amount donated and amount of impact achieved (1 of 6 studies)\nKawumara et al, 2020, perhaps in contrast to the above, seems to suggest that ‘effectiveness’ is rewarded with reputation. he people in the vignettes did seem to be rewarded (assessed as having both higher warmth and competence) by the participants for achieving a greater benefit, holding cost constant\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations\nEven if we accept the above evidence (that those who make consequentialist active choices in “sacrificial dilemmas” are seen as less trustworthy and less moral) this may not generalize to effective giving. Researching and selecting a more effective charity is closest to the ‘track switching’ scenario in these experiments, in which no substantial difference was observed, and even here it is a stretch. Choosing a more effective charity instead of a more local one (e.g., river blindess prevention in Africa versus local guide Dogs) would be hard to cast seen as taking an active step to harm someone.5\n\n\nIndirect evidence\n(Kahane et al.

    "text": "9.1 General relevance to effective giving\nFor people to choose one product over another product on the basis of some characteristic (e.g., safety, taste, or durability), they presumably must be aware of these differences before purchasing. Economists note the difficulty of investing in producing, marketing and selling high-quality products and services when consumers have difficulty distinguishing these products from inferior ones ( Dulleck and Kerschbamer (2006); Nelson (1970), Shapiro (1983)). This is especially difficult when the quality of a product is not known before purchase (an ‘experience good’ such as a ticket to a particular stage show, see ibid), or when it is not known until a long time later, if at all (a ‘credence good’ such as a health remedy or investment advice Dulleck and Kerschbamer (2006))\n\n\n\nConsidering a charitable donation as a ‘product purchased by the donor’, it seems to fall into the latter category of ‘credence good’. If donors value their ‘marginal impact on outcomes’ as discussed in our earlier definitions of impact, they may need to do extensive research (or at least know about and visit web sites such as GiveWell) to have some estimate of the value-for-money they are getting.1\n\n\nA typical charitable donor, particularly one who donates towards a geographically-distant intervention, will never directly see or experience the consequences of her donation. Thus, for people to systematically choose to donate to the most effective charities, presumably…\n\nThey must understand and value the idea of effectiveness.\nThey must either:\n\n\n\nalready know how effective charities are relative to one another,\n\n\nhave reliable information on this presented to them by the charities (or other entities),\n\n\nor they must want to and find it appropriate to seek information on this, and be able to obtain reliable information.\n\n\n\n(For B or C to have the desired effect…) The act of learning about effectiveness must not substantially decrease their willingness to donate.\n\n\nIn this section we consider the evidence for\nPeople’s aversion/willingness (or sense that it is appropriate/inappropriate) to evaluate effectiveness in a charitable giving context\nand other obstacles tied to this."

    "text": "9.2 General cost-benefit analysis (CBA)-aversion or reluctance\n2\n\n\n9.2.1 Description\nPeople may be reluctant3 to consider the cost and benefits of the actions they are funding through their charitable donations (or they find this less appropriate/normal). This contrasts with a much greater willingness to consider these and other domains such as consumption, investment, and public policy. People also seem to avoid accessing/buying/seeing information (particularly information that may be likely to make them feel compelled to give.)\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Conceptual discussion\nFor this to be considered a bias, the relevant individuals must intrinsically value the usefulness of their charitable activity at least to some extent.4 However, they may consider it very costly or distasteful to actually do this evaluation, or it may clash with other motivations and tendencies.\nThis aversion also must be distinguished from a lack of ability to do CBA in the charity domain; the latter would instead be considered a quantitative bias.\nThe reluctance to engage in this evaluation process may relate to the idea of “taboo trade-offs”; if these tradeoffs are taboo, considering them may involve great emotional distress.5\n(Berman et al. 2018) refer to the idea that “believing that charity is a subjective decision licenses individuals to donate in personally gratifying ways.” This perspective plausibly combines partial and conflicted utililitarian preferences with the presence of moral licensing. As these authors note, the belief that CBA is not a natural part of the charitable domain may stem from the lack of direct feedback one gets from donating (in Economics terms, a “credence” good) relative to consumption and investment goods.6\n\nSeveral papers (Null (2011), Fong and Oberholzer-Gee (2010), Metzger and Günther (2019)) find evidence that (arguably) suggests that people are often reluctant to pay for (and may even actively avoid) certain information about charitable costs and benefits. People are also known to ‘avoiding being asked’ in general (DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier (2012), Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman (2017)). However, these may reflect motives distinct from CBA, such as a self-serving bias .7\n\nCBA: Roots in Psychological theory\nThis ‘CBA discomfort’* can be connected to several (potentially overlapping) theoretical frameworks:\n\nFiske’s Relational Theory (Fiske (1992); also see Aggarwal (2004)), which proposes four basic types of social relationships: 1. communal sharing, 2. authority ranking, 3. equality matching, and 4. market pricing. For more on this, see Heyman and Ariely (2004) on social vs economic markets.\nTaboo Tradeoffs and Protected Values: to the extent that CBA requires making taboo tradeoffs (e.g., choosing between saving one life and saving another) that clash with protected values, people may be reticent to engage in CBA for prosocial purposes.\n‘Distorted Altruists’: People do care about welfare maximization, *but “without clear information to make comparisons* they rely on their feelings to guide their choice” Berman et al. (2018), citing (Loewenstein and Small (2007); and Slovic (2007)).8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevance to Effective Giving (restated)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf determining which charity is effective requires cost-benefit analysis (CBA), people may avoid doing so. If effective charities force people to consider CBA then people may avoid these charities in order to avoid having to do these evaluations.\nStated more broadly, effective giving is predicated on CBAs for programs and organizations. Donors must engage with these CBAs and carefully evaluating which sources are trustworthy and meaningful. To the extent that people are uncomfortable with doing this in the charitable domain, it will be difficult for them to give effectively."

    "text": "9.3 Evidence: attitudes towards CBA in the charitable domain, CBA-avoidance\n\nEvidence for claim: “People sometimes actively avoid information about charity effectiveness…”\nTangentially related: many people tend to ‘avoid being asked or pressured to donate’ (DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier (2012), Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman (2017)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n(DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier 2012) provide field experimental evidence that people will pay costs to avoid being asked and avoid social pressure. However, for this same case if they are asked they then to respond by giving. While “avoiding the ask” is not avoiding cost-benefit analysis, it suggests that people are in fact strategic in avoiding things that may make them feel compelled to donate.\nAndreoni, Rao, and Trachtman (2017) find a related result in a distinct field setting.\n\n\n\nAlso somewhat tangentially, Dana, Weber, and Kuang (2007) find, in a modified laboratory dictator game, that about 40% of subjects choose not to learn (at no cost) about the payoffs of the recipient subjects, in a context where this affords them ‘moral wiggle room’ not to donate.\n\n\nEvidence for: “People rarely seek out effectiveness information and are reluctant to purchase it”\n\nNull (2011)\nIn the final stage of an experiment from Null (2011)…\n\nSubjects were given the option to spend USD 5 of their total gift to the development charities in order to find out which of the three would receive a matching rate of USD 3 (the other two would receive matching rates of USD 1.50). Altruistic subjects whose donation was at least USD 20 and gave to all three charities, or whose total gift is greater than USD 35 and gave to two charities, would find it profitable to purchase the information. … (84%) met these criteria on gift size and number of charities supported.\n\n\n…only 40% of subjects were willing to give up a small portion of their endowments in order to find out which charity would receive the highest rate; the rest preferred to allocate their gifts without knowing what they would be worth to the charities.”\n\n\n…These subjects who chose not to purchase the information forfeited matching funds ranging from 30-150% of the value of their unmatched gifts, with the median donor sacrificing matching funds exactly equal to the value of her unmatched gift, a truly staggering sum.\n\nNull attributes this failure to buy information either to subjects who “simply did not care about the potential to substitute into the charity with the highest matching rate”, perhaps driven by some form of simplistic warm glow motive, or to simple misunderstanding or fatigue (in an incentivized elicitation, she found some evidence of incomplete comprehension). To the extent this is not a misunderstanding, it might be seen as evidence of CBA aversion; participants did not want to purchase evidence that would require them to do calculations in this domain.’9\nNull’s result is interesting but it involves unique, somewhat unusual, and somewhat artificial contexts. The participants were aware that they were in an experiment.\n\n\nOther papers involving laboratory ‘real charitable giving’ experiments also find a relative lack of willingness to pay for effectiveness-related information.\n\n\nMetzger and Günther (2019)\nMetzger and Günther (2019) run a laboratory experiment, where participants have the opportunity to donate (from their lab income) under\n\none of three information settings: aid impact, recipient type, or administrative costs… Within each information setting, participants were randomly assigned to a “high-” or “low-performing” NGO and randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups. Participants in the treatment group had the opportunity to buy detailed information about whether they were matched with the high- or low-performing NGO.\n\nIn the most relevant ‘aid impact’ setting, the difference in impact was explained as\n\nDepending on which project, the NGO will make the following impact:\n\n\nProject 1 will employ an additional teacher, which would, for every franc donated, enable one student to remain in school for 1 week longer.\n\n\nProject 2 will provide a meal to students at school, which would, for every franc donated, enable one student to remain in school for 1.5 weeks longer.\n\n\nProject 2 (providing a meal at school) is 50% more effective than project 1 (financing an additional teacher). The efficiency of an additional teacher and the efficiency of providing a meal at school has been assessed in several scientific studies.\n\nThis does indeed, seem like the sort of ‘real quantitative impact information’ we are considering in this context, although the very sparse description might not make this as credible as we would like.10\nOverall, they find a relative lack of interest in purchasing this information.\n\nOur main results are the following. First, while only 28.73% (se = 0.03) of the participants in the treatment group buy the offered information, 57.09% (se = 0.02) donate to charity. That means, about 28% of the participants make an uninformed donation. Second, demand varies considerably across information types. Demand for information on aid impact is the lowest with 22.33% (se = 0.04) and highest for information on the recipient type (37.81%, se = 0.05). …\n\n\nLast, we find that non-buyers do not respond to information: they hardly change their donation behavior when they receive information for free. This suggests that individuals, who decide against acquiring additional information do not understand, do not trust, or do not care about the information provided in this laboratory experiment.\n\nDoes this demonstrate ‘participants did not buy information because they don’t care about effectiveness?’ (Discussion in fold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average donation of ‘aid non-buyers’ was about 2.5 Swiss franks (CHF). (Figure 6). The information costs 0.3 (CHF) If the information is reliable, it could increase the value of the actoin by 25% on average; the 50% more efficient charity is assigned half the time. If the individual prefers to donate only to the more efficient charity, the relative value might be worth about .625 CHF total, or 0.325 more than its cost. Perhaps\nNote this may be an underestimate; this ‘average donation’ already reflects uncertainty about the value of the donation.\n(Note: I would need to think about this decision problem in more detail; this is an attempt at an order of magnitude.)\n\n\n\nThe comparison to the purchases of information in the other context also seems overstated. The ‘information on the recipient type’ may itself be seen as (and may actually be, in this case) an important measure of impact. The ‘recipient type’ determines whether the charity ‘focuses on promoting the education of children’ versus whether it ‘focuses on promoting the education of young artists’. As the authors admit, participants may believe “that donating to children will generally have a larger development impact than donating to artists, considering the recipient type as a proxy for the impact of a donation”.11\nFong and Oberholzer-Gee (2010) also finds some loosely related evidence (see fold).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nFong and Oberholzer-Gee (2010) run dictator game experiments involving payments to real-life welfare recipients living in 178 public housing in Pittsburgh; each subject is matched with a particular recipient of their potential donation. In their “Choice treatment”, a subject can choose to pay $1 to learn about a recipient’s drug use or disability, information meant to suggest the deservingness of the recipient. “We find that a third of the dictators are willing to pay money to learn more about their recipient. Dictators who acquire information mostly use it to withhold resources from less-preferred types, leading to a drastic decline in aggregate transfers.”\nBut this needs to be interpreted carefully: those who decide not to buy information appear less generous than the average!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1 Evidence for “people accept and value subjectivity in the charitable domain more so than for other choice domains”\n(Berman et al. 2018) provide evidence from a series of five survey/vignette experiments; unlike those mentioned above, these (mostly) involve hypothetical choices among multiple causes. All experiments use standard subject pools (behavioral lab subjects or Mturkers) with reasonably large samples. All ask for hypothetical (Likert-scale) responses involving fictional charities, investments, and other scenarios; they mostly rely on between-subject responses, and their statistical analyses report reasonable tests on the relevant comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDhort summary from Berman et al. (2018) on their findings):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1 showed that, relative to personal decisions, individuals view charity as being relatively subjective. Study 2 showed that individuals prioritize emotional connection over welfare maximization when comparing charity options. Study 3 examined choice processes and found that people are more likely to override welfare maximization when choosing a charity than when choosing a financial investment. The final two studies found that individuals are less likely to license themselves (Study 4) and others (Study 5) to select an ineffective option when a decision maker assumes a position of responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nTheir “Study 1: Perceived Subjectivity of Charity” found that, in rating statements such as\n“it is important that the ______ I choose reflects my personal tastes or values”\nand\n“It is more important to rely on objective measures rather than personal feelings when choosing ______” …\nthey found people agreed more with the subjective/taste approach when assigned a treatment where the blank was “Charity”, relative to those assigned treatments involving medical treatments, investments, and cell phones. (But less than some other things like art, and similar to restaurants in some tests!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology from Berman et al. (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants were asked to evaluate how they believe they should make decisions across six decision domains (choosing a charity, an investment, a cell phone, a restaurant, a piece of art, and a medical treatment). Specifically, they evaluated the extent to which they agreed with the following statements: “It is important that the _____ I choose reflects my personal tastes or values,” “It is more important to rely on objective measures rather than personal feelings when choosing _____,” and “Objective measures are the best way to choose _____.” Responses were made on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so).\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir “Study 2: Personal Feelings Versus Welfare Gains” presented participants with “Mary” and a pairing of fictional domestic (homelessness) and international (micronutrient) charities, presenting effectiveness information on both (clearly favoring the latter).\nThe treatment—changing ‘which charity Mary felt an emotional connection to’—had a significant impact on the response to “Which charity should Mary donate to”, in the predicted direction.\nThey were also asked: “Which option does the greatest good for the greatest number of people?”; here responses favored the international charity for both treatments; but even so, when Mary felt connected to local charity, participants favored her donating there.\n(Unfold for the authors’ description of this methodology and results…)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology from Berman et al. (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants read a scenario involving Mary, who was looking to donate money to one of two hypothetical charities. One charity, Hunger Care in Africa, was described as providing micronutrients for children in Africa, and for each USD 100 donated, this charity could feed five children for a month. A second charity, Jump Start Your Community, was described as training and educating the homeless in Mary’s community, and for every USD 100 donated, this charity could provide 2 hr of job training to one homeless person\n\n\nEach participant was then randomly assigned to one of two emotional-connection conditions. In the local-causes condition, participants read that Mary feels an emotional connection toward helping people in local communities, whereas in the distant-causes condition, participants read that Mary feels an emotional connection toward helping those in third-world countries\n\n\nWe then presented participants with two different questions on separate pages in random order. One question assessed where they felt Mary should donate (“Which charity should Mary donate to?”), whereas the other question asked which charity was the most effective at maximizing social welfare (“Suppose that Mary wanted to donate to the charity that did the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Which one should she donate to?”). Both questions were measured on a 7-point scale from 1 (definitely Jump Start Your Community) to 7 (definitely Hunger Care in Africa)\n\nBerman et al. (2018) summarized their results from this study as follows:\n\nWhen participants read that Mary felt an emotional connection with distant charities, they responded that she should donate to Hunger Care in Africa… and also evaluated it as being more effective… However, when Mary felt connected to local communities, they indicated that she should donate to Jump Start Your Community…, despite indicating that Hunger Care in Africa was more effective\n\n\n\n\n13\nIn their “Study 3: Charity Versus Investment Choice”, subjects were assigned categories and fictional examples of either charities or investment opportunities, and presented domain categories and effectiveness information for each. Fewer participants in the charity treatment (relative to the investment treatment) chose to sort by effectiveness rating, and fewer chose the highest-rated option.\n(Unfold for further discussion of study 3…)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 3 built on the ideas from Study 1. Effective altruism suggests that to make the biggest difference, people should try to maximize welfare, analogously investors seeking maximize their financial returns. However, Study 1 suggested that individuals viewed objective information as more important in making financial decisions than in charitable decisions. The third study from Berman et al. (2018) tries to more directly compare the two, using the following method:\n\nParticipants were also told that the website organizes options into six different categories (alternative energy, cancer, education, food, housing, and international). These categories were chosen because they could plausibly represent groupings of either charities or investments.\n\n\nParticipants were then given the choice to sort the options either by effectiveness or by category type. Sorting by effectiveness suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting one of the most effective charities or investments, whereas sorting by category suggested that an individual was primarily concerned with selecting a charity or investment that reflected a preferred option type\n\nThey found that participants were significantly more likely to sort by effectiveness in the investment condition than in the charity condition. Furthermore, when the options were ranked, “participants chose a less effective charity… than investment”.\n\n\n\nStudy 4 and 5 both examined how responsibility changes people’s perception of how important objective information is. Berman et al. (2018) hypothesized that “when individuals assume a role of responsibility, they may feel obligated to act in accordance with the welfare of the entire group and will discount their personal preferences to do so”.\nIn Study 4, they find that, in rating research departments for funding, participants pay more attention to charity effectiveness ratings when the are given the “role” of a “president of a local medical research center” rather than a donor. Similarly, in Study 5 participants assess someone who allocates funds to a research department; participants respond to the effectiveness of the department chosen more when rating the decision quality and altruism/selfishness of a “president…” than rating a “donor”.\n\n\n\n(Unfold for further details of study 4…)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Study 4, participants were assigned to a donor condition or a president condition, and then participants were either given information on effectiveness ratings, or there was no mention of effectiveness ratings.\n\nParticipants assigned to the donor condition imagined that they lived near a local research center. Participants assigned to the president condition imagined that they were the president of a local medical research center. Participants in the donor condition were then told that “because the market has done well, you have more cash than usual. You would like to help by making a donation to medical research.” Participants in the president condition were told that “Because the stock market has done well, the research center has more cash than usual. As president, it is part of your job to allocate these funds to conduct additional medical research.” Each participant was then given his or her choice between allocating funds to one of three departments, with effectiveness ratings provided for each department… These ratings were purposefully selected so that the most intuitively appealing choice was rated as the least effective (cancer), and the least appealing choice was rated as the most effective (arthritis), thereby creating a tension between the option that would be most personally gratifying and the option that would maximize welfare\n\nTheir results suggested that people paid more attention to the effectiveness ratings when they were in a position of responsibility:\n\nWhen the effectiveness ratings were absent, the assigned role did not significantly affect the option that participants chose… However, when the ratings were present, participants in the president condition were significantly more likely to select higher rated options than those in the donor condition… Although participants used effectiveness ratings when given this information, significantly more did so when placed in a position of responsibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 5 details\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir fifth study used a similar methodology to Study 4, to examine “how individuals judge others who select either a relatively effective or an ineffective option”, using the following method:\n\nThe study has a 2 (role: donor vs. medical center president) x 2 (choice: most effective option vs. least effective option) between-subjects design. Participants read a scenario about Mr. Peterson, an individual who was allocating money to a local medical research center. In the donor condition, participants read that Mr. Peterson was looking to donate money from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center. In the president condition, participants read that Mr. Peterson was the president of the medical research center and that he was looking to allocate surplus funds from recent stock market gains to a department within the medical center In all conditions, participants then read about an independent research firm that evaluates the effectiveness of departments in the same fashion as the previous study … Participants then evaluated the extent to which they thought the decision was responsible, appropriate, and thoughtful\n\nAs with Study 4, the results suggested that people thought effectiveness information was more important for people in positions of responsibility:\n\nIn both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr. Peterson’s decision was of lower quality when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, the drop in decision quality was significantly greater when he was president… than when he was a donor In both the president and the donor conditions, participants felt that Mr. Peterson’s decision was less altruistic when he selected the least effective option over the most effective option. However, this difference was greater when Mr. Peterson was president… than when he was a donor\n\n\n\n\nOverall, these suggest that, when considering charitable donations, people tend to favor–or at least to accept–the use of subjective preferences and personal ties, rather than objective information, and they do so more than for more “standard” goods and choices. This is more accepted for “donors” than for people with responsibility for others’ funds.\nIn their analysis of the studies, Berman et al. (2018) concluded with the following:\n\nOur results suggest that people view charity decisions as being relatively subjective, which inhibits the impact of effectiveness information on welfare maximization. Thus, to persuade people to make donation decisions that maximize social welfare, providing information alone may not be sufficient. Rather, it may require altering how individuals view their role as a donor altogether14\n\nHowever (as they do note), the effectiveness information still has some (positive) effect on participants’ responses; it is not ignored. Their experiments also do not analyze the avoidance of information or CBA.\n\n\nMethodological strengths and weaknesses:\n\nHypothetical nature of choices (a limitation)\nSome evidence suggestng these are not taken seriously\nSpecific context in vignettes allow alternative interpretations…"

However, we focus on field and ’field-like’ experiments involving truthful analytical ‘impact-per-dollar’ relevant information in settings involving substantial donations.\nThe experimental evidence is limited, mixed and overall indeterminate. We could only find a single large-scale field trial closely bearing on ‘impact-per-dollar’ information. (Karlan and Wood 2017) ran a field experiment on a charitable mailing campaign for Freedom From Hunger, reporting mixed (null overall, positive for some subgroups, negative for others), and some underpowered results. Small, Loewenstein, and Slovic (2007) (involving laboratory experiments with real donations) find that giving to an identifiable victim is reduced when statistics are also presented and “priming analytic thinking reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime.” Bergh and Reinstein (2020)’s work (M-turk charitable giving, plus one small-scale field-ish context) mainly finds a near-zero effect (e.g., in pooled analysis across all six experiments, see table 1 right column, table 2 bottom, and appendix page 51. *\nFurther related evidence is also indeterminate (see fold).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTrussel and Parsons (2007) finds a positive impact of providing a particular type of analytical charity financial information on a subset of donors.\nThere is also mixed evidence on the impact of real-world charity ratings (Yoruk 2016; Brown ea 2017; Gordon ‘ea ’19), and mixed evidence on ’excuse-driven information seeking’ (Exley ’16b; Fong & O, ’10; Metzger & G ’19).\nThere is some further related evidence lab experiments, but the results are limited. Fong and Oberholzer-Gee (2010) apparently findd that exogenous information about recipients increases donations, but they do not report this specifically. There is some speculation, but again, mixed evidence, that individuals already in a “system 2” (deliberative) frame are more likely to be positively affected by impact information. There is also a distinction to be further explored between “output information” (how the donation is used) and “impact information”; the former is seen to increase generosity in several studies. [Reference needed here]\n\n\n\n\nWe are planning more careful multilevel/meta-analysis of this work, incorporating ‘new evidence’ from a set of field experiments run by Reinstein and others involving two distinct charities and three campaigns.\n\n\nPresenting “Effectiveness” and other types of analytical efficiency information\nKarlan and Wood (2017) KW (2017) run a field experiment on a charitable mailing involving scientific impact information. Their treatment involved adding scientific impact text to an appeal, while removing some emotional text:\nEffectiveness treatment language:\n\nAccording to studies on our programs in Peru that used rigorous scientific methodologies, women who have received both loans and business education saw their profits grow, even when compared to women who just received loans for their businesses. But the real difference comes when times are slow. The study showed that women in Freedom from Hunger’s Credit with Education program kept their profits strong–ensuring that their families would not suffer, but thrive.\n\nControl (emotional) treatment language:\n\nBecause of caring people like you, Freedom from Hunger was able to offer Sebastiana a self-help path toward achieving her dream of getting “a little land to farm” and pass down to her children. As Sebastiana’s young son, Aurelio, runs up to hug her, she says, “I do whatever I can for my children.”\n\nThey find a null effect overall with fairly tight bounds. They report a near-0 impact on incidence (in table 2: column 1), and a standard error under 1%, relative to a baseline incidence of 14%. They estimate an impact on amount of donated +2.35 USD, with a standard error of 1.98; this is relative to a mean of 14.17 USD. (In their Winsorised results the point estimate is -0.074, the standard error is 0.82, and the mean is 11.30)\nWhen they differentiate this by an ex-post classification (not preregistered), they find positive effects of this information for ‘prior large donors’ and negative effects for ‘prior small donors’.\nThis is probably the most substantial and relevant study. We consider this further in our meta-analysis further below.\nNonetheless, the study is presents only a single piece of evidence from a specific context. It also has some potential limitations in considering our main question.\n\nTheir treatment changed two things changed at once: impact information was added which emotional information was removed\nIt may have been entangled with a Yale/institution effect\nThe nature of ‘impact’ information was not particularly quantative; it did not express a an ‘impact per dollar’\n\n\nDesign and results summary:\nTreatment(s): Add scientific impact text to base script (included a standard qualitative story about an individual beneficiary), while removing emotional text:\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) little net effect\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) reduced (increased) giving among small (large) prior donors (not a preregistered hypothesis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinda, Organizations, and Parsons (2007)\n2 x 2 mailing appeal for People with Aids Coalition-Houston, with several treatments:\n\nadding “service efforts and accomplishment info”(SEA),\nand adding favorable “FINANCIAL” spending/overhead ratio infos.\n\nThe FINANCIAL treatment (alone) \\(\\rightarrow\\) 180% increase in odds of donating among prior donors (\\(p<0.05\\))\n(The other effects are mainly insignificant, with wide error margins, suggesting the study was underpowered)\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics('../picsfigs/parsons_fin_treat.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther details from Parsons (unfold, direct quotes from paper)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n(This is all direct quotations:)\nPotential donors were sent, via a direct mail campaign, fundraising appeals containing varying amounts of financial and nonfinancial information in order to determine whether individual donors are more likely to contribute when accounting information or voluntary disclosures are provided …\n\n\nA logistic regression provides evidence that some donors who have previously donated use financial accounting information when making a donation decision. The results are inconclusive regarding whether donors use nonfinancial service efforts and accomplishments disclosures to determine whether and how much to give, but participants in the lab experiment judged the nonfinancial disclosures to be useful for making a giving decision\n\n\nBoth experiments use a two-by-two design to manipulate the direct provision of (1) financial information (derived from mandatory informational tax filings which are available only if requested by the donor) and (2) voluntary disclosure of nonfinancial accounting information (not otherwise available to the donor). By analyzing actual cash receipts from the fundraising appeal, I find that donors who had previously contributed to the organization are more likely to donate when financial accounting information is directly provided. New prospective donors make larger contributions when either financial information or voluntary, nonfinancial accounting information is included with a basic fundraising appeal, but differences are not statistically significant.\n\n\nThe first manipulation is to include financial information drawn from the audited financial statements with the basic fundraising appeal. Summary charts and graphs, instead of full financial statements complete with footnotes, are used to highlight the efficiency measures typically emphasized in previous literature. The financial information indicates that 92.5 percent of the entity’s expenditures were directed to program expenses in the prior year. This figure compares favorably with the 60 percent suggested minimum level recommended by the National Charities Information Bureau\n\nThe second manipulation is to include a voluntary disclosure of service efforts and accomplishments (SEA) that describes the organization’s past efforts to serve its beneficiaries and gives specific information about the success of its programs (see Appendix C). This information is in narrative form and written in lay terms. 3 It provides both output (quantity of product or service produced) and outcomes (results) information as defined in Hatry et al. (1990).\n\n\nCharity: People with Aids Coalition- Houston\n\n\n\nLimitations of @Linda2007 (for the present question)\n\nThe efficiency measures they use, while largely analytical (thus, helpfully, potentially triggering dual-process shifts), is not meaningful ‘impact-per=dollar’ or ‘output-per-dollar’ information\nThey highlight a differentiated treatment effect, but this may be an ex-post comparison. They don’t report pre-registration.\n\n\n\nUnclear at times, missing some important information:\n\nIs the model a logit or LPM?\nNot effect-coded; no measure of overall impact of FINANCIAL across both SEA treatments.\nConfidence intervals are not shown\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1.1 Bergh and Reinstein (2020) (Lab and field experiments)\nFrom Abstract:\n\nAcross six experiments we examined how images of identified victims interact with information about charity efficiency (money toward program) and effectiveness (program outcome). We further examined if the images primarily get people to donate (yes/no), while efficiency/effectiveness might provide a tuning mechanism for how much to give. Results showed that images influenced the propensity to donate and induced participants donate their full bonuses, indicating heuristic effects. Efficiency and effectiveness information had no effects on donations.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on above table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note that in the above, all binary variables are ‘effect coded’) Considering ‘Don share’ (the share of the endowment contributed), as well as the linear probability model, we see that the pooled effect of the effectiveness information is fairly tightly bounded around zero. Even at the 95% lower bound, the effect is no more than an 11% reduction in the share donated (.04/0.35), and a 10% reduction in incidence (.06/.62).\n\n\n\n\nStudy 6 had the most straightforward ‘impact information’ as per our definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove we see estimated of odds ratios, relative to the control group, of the incidence of donating to RB (Carter Center: the river-blindness charity) and GD (Guide Dogs for the blind). Confidence intervals reveal a lack of power. However, there is suggestive evidence (p=0.09 and p=0.16, respectively) that the image lead people to be less-likely to donate to GD and more likely to donate to RB. This may have been driven by the African appearance of the blind girl depicted.\n\nThe wide confidence intervals of the odds ratios suggests that Study 6 had limited statstical power.\n\n\n10.1.1.2 (Caviola, Schubert, and Nemirow 2020) (Hypothetical/intentional experiments; Information treatments, debunking/debiasing) {#caviola}3\n\nSeries of four hypothetical experiments, mainly on M-Turk\n\n\nAbstract: … Across six tasks (Studies 1a, 1b), we found support for both explanations. Among lay donors, we observed multiple misconceptions—regarding disaster relief, overhead costs, donation splitting, and the relative effectiveness of local and foreign charities—that reduced the effectiveness of their giving. [*]\n\n\nSimilarly, we found that they were unfamiliar with the most effective charities (Studies 2a, 2b). Debunking these misconceptions and informing people about effectiveness boosted effective donations [*]; however, a portion of lay donors continued to give ineffectively to satisfy their personal preferences.\n\n\nBy contrast, a sample of self-identified effective altruists gave [*] effectively across all tasks.^[Notes on this paper are adapted from Janek Kretschmer’s work.\n\n* All experiments in this paper involved hypothetical (stated) giving ‘choices’. ]\n\n\nSummarised findings (as reported by authors) and main points:\n\nBoth ‘lack of knowledge’ and preferences impede effective giving\nIt is important to understand the (ambivalent) relationship between the desire to do the most good and ‘knowing about the best option’ and ‘actually giving to the most effective charities’\nThere are huge difference between ‘EA donors’ and the general population [?] (lay people) in term of knowledge and preferences\nStudy 2 finds strong effects of informing participants about GiveWell’s top-recommended charities:\n\ne.g., in Study 2a, it resulted in 41% of participants expressing an interest in donating to one of them.\n\nMisconceptions about charities and preferences for ineffective options were closely linked\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1.3 (Mulesky 2020) - Hypothetical choices, realistic versus over-optimistic impact information\n(Unfold key elements of abstract)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… investigates whether donor-driven market incentives can explain why nonprofit organizations routinely lack an evidentiary basis to justify their operations. Across three preregistered online survey experiments (N = 1,058), two domains (global health and human rights), and two types of interventions (medical care and issue-awareness), this paper finds that people do not reward exceptionally positive charitable impact, but they do punish charities that admit their programs were ineffective. Charities are only rewarded for revealing information about their impact when the results are unrealistic and unattainable. The results also demonstrate that donors are more sensitive to information about administrative overhead than they are to direct information about impact.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nParticipants “recruited through Positly, an online study recruiter that solicits high quality participants from Amazon’s M-Turk”\nSeries of experiments giving participants a hypothetical choice: “you have the opportunity to donate 100 USD to i. [described charity] or ii. Some other international health charity.” They needed to hypothetically allocate the 100USD completely between these two.\n\n\n\nStudy 1 treatments:\n\nNo Impact information\nNull Impact information (“study found that Human Rights International did not have the desired impact, suggesting that reform is needed to increase effectiveness’.)\nRealistic impact information … “results of the study suggest … [HHI} saves the life of one person for each 2000 USD spent”\nUnrealistic impact information “… for each 150 USD spent”\n\n\n\nStudy 2: Similar to Study 1, but for preventing HIV infections4\n\n\nResults considered\nStated finding:\n\nCharities are only rewarded for revealing information about their impact when the results are unrealistic and unattainable.\n\nIn fact, the mean donations were ordered: Unrealistic (Impact information) \\(>\\) Realistic \\(>\\) No(ne) \\(>\\) Null.\nWhile the difference between Realistic and None was not significant by the standard tests, the confidence interval does not rule out an affect of up to almost 15 percentage points.\n\nOther comments (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nComments from Janek Kretschmer:\n\nThe author considers three aspects of the ‘problem’ with beliefs: no-reward for actual high impact, punishment for low impact, and reward for unrealistic high impact. This might be reduced to the simple assumption that actual cost-effectiveness information can not live up to donors’ expectations [which] makes an investment into scientific evaluation unprofitable for NGOs.\nThe results may largely be explained by the evaluation bias (Caviola et al. 2014). This could be emphasized further.\nIn study 3, the presentation of possible overhead spending is potentially too negative.\nAlso, after accounting for overhead the difference between both scenarios is small 2000 USD vs. 1800 USD, and more mental resources are required to obtain this conclusion\nMore information about the “another charity option” would be helpful. Ideally, the author would provide the participants’ decision screen in the appendix.\n\nWhen the author wonders whether “active donors […] differ from the general population,” she asks a relevant question (cf. Karlan and Woods, 2017). However, she simply provides the mean donation (M = 70.9 USD) to Human Health International among respondents who have donated in the past twelve months. Thus, it can be said that there is no statistical difference from the mean donation (M = 69.9 USD) among all respondents, including non-donors However, the more interesting question “do large donors react differently to the four conditions?” remains answered.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1.4 Evidence: Analytical information \\(\\times\\) emotional information and ‘identifiable victim’\n(Kogut and Ritov 2011; Loewenstein and Small 2007; Small, Loewenstein, and Slovic 2007) (Drouvelis and Grosskopf 2016), (Caviola et al. 2014)\n\n\n(Small, Loewenstein, and Slovic 2007), studies 3-4\nStudy 3:\n\nindividuals who faced an identifiable victim donated more than those who faced victim statistics, p < .01, and also donated more than those who faced an identifiable victim in conjunction with statistics, p < .05.\n\n(They interpret the statistics as possibly ‘debiasing’ the IVE)\n\n\n\nStudy 4: “Priming analytic thinking [math problems] reduced donations to an identifiable victim relative to a feeling-based thinking prime [”impression questionnaire”]. Yet, the primes had no distinct effect on donations to statistical victims, which is symptomatic of the difficulty in generating feelings for these victims.”\n\n\n\nConsiderations\nBasic design has key strengths: Double-blind, real donations, distractors, careful use of language.\nPrimes: Note, the latter non-effect appears tightly bounded; but this could simply be driven by nonlinearity. If people gave little to statistical victims, there is less room for this to decrease further. A classic problem when considering interactions.\n\nIdeas42 Summary:\nResearchers gave study participants the opportunity to donate $0-5 to famine relief efforts at Save the Children (n = 159). One group received letters that included a picture and brief description of a little girl. A second group received letters describing factual information about food security, and a third group received letters with both the little girl’s profile and factual information. The photo and description prompted an emotion-based response, raising more than twice as much money as the factual solicitation. Including factual information with the girl’s profile reduced this effect, with no significant difference in giving between those who received both pieces and those who received factual information only\n\n\n\n\n\nBergh and Reinstein, 2020, SPSS"

    "text": "10.2 Overall ‘net’ responses to charity ratings\nThere is a small body of evidence on how charity quality ratings (which are not typically ‘impact’ ratings as we have defined it) affect, or at least correlate with a charity’s fundraising success. The effect of these ratings presumably relates both to individual’s willingness to seek out and process this information (as in our discussion of CBA), and to the impact of this information on an individual’s generosity… .\n\n10.2.1 Evidence on responses to charity ratings\nOne characterization, from Bergh and Reinstein (2020)\n\nSome work further suggests that changes in charity ratings lead to changes in charity revenues (e.g., Gordon, Knock, and Neely (2009); Yörük (2016)), but it is unclear if this is driven by efficiency evaluations per se. For instance, people might respond to the number of stars given to a charity without deeply considering what these stars represent.\n\n\nYörük (2016).\n“Charity ratings” Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 25(1), 195-219.\n\nRelevance: Reasonably strong causal evidence that in general, charity ratings may boost a charity’s fundraising, at least for some types of charities. However, this is based on Charity Navigator ratings, which do not generally agree with our measures of impact.\n \nType of evidence: Observational, claiming causality through a regression discontinuity framework\n\nCharity Navigator stars are based on a continuous score across categories\nIdentification via RD: Impact of crossing a ‘star’ threshold on amounts raised\n\n\n\nBackground mechanisms and related evidence: the role of consumer reviews and independent ratings in for-profit sectors.5\n\nKey findings:\n\nFor relatively smaller and unknown charities one star increase in ratings is (causally) associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Evidence for “Charity choices do not respond ‘efficiently’ to information about costs and benefits of charity”\nNull (2011) ran a set of experiments at Kiwanis/Rotary clubs and with “professional subjects” (presumably, university administrators) at the Berkeley X-lab. The former strictly involved allocations among charities, in the latter case what was not given away could be kept. For the main reported treatments, participants made a series of decisions under different incentives (mostly on the same page and thus simultaneously?). The “prize” was $100; in each session only one decision from one subject was chosen for actual payment/donations.\nMany participants who choose to donate positive amounts to multiple charities in earlier (?stages) continue to donate to multiple charities when one charity is given a better match rate; they only “imperfectly substitute” (and some even substitute away from the now “lower-priced” charity). She attributes this to both risk aversion (diminishing utility in to each charity’s actual impact, along with uncertainty about this impact) as well to as a version of “warm glow” with a diminishing marginal benefit in the amount given to each charity.\nShe also introduces exogenous risks over matching rates, and notes that roughly 2/3 of those that choose to shift only imperfectly are not measured to be “risk averse”.\nHowever, this could also be attributed to a simple failure to make these cost-benefit calculations (as she also found some evidence suggesting misunderstanding of the nature of these incentives).\nNote: There is a great deal of other evidence on this point that should be incorporated. The Null experiment makes this particular explicit, but I believe there is substantial additional work, both involving experiments that participants were aware* of, and in more natural contexts.*\n* Consider also (Metzger and Günther 2019).\n\n\nSee also\nVesterlund (2003) Chhaochharia, Ghosh, et al.

    "text": "11.3 Proportional dominance effect {#prop-dom}1\nProportional dominance effect/drop in bucket/psychosocial numbing/psychophysical numbing\n\n\n11.3.1 Definition\nRelated Terms include: Drop in the bucket; mechanisms include “futility thinking” (Unger?), psychosocial numbing, quantitative confusion/innumeracy\n\nThis claim can be summarized as follows:\n(For a given per-dollar impact on the outcome), people are be less willing to donate towards a cause when the magnitude of the underlying problem is (framed as) larger.\nMechanism: Underlying this is the idea that a certain amount of impact (e.g., relieving suffering) is perceived as smaller and thus less valuable when the underlying problem is larger.\n\n\n11.3.2 Conceptual Discussion2\nDefinitional issues and disambiguation\nThis needs to be distinguished from scope insensitivity. Note that if people are being analytical, they must care about scope in order to care about their impact, and thus (mistakenly) react to the perceived lower impact of donating when the needs are much greater. PD arguments may also be used as vehicle for motivated reasoning, and thus not be an important driver in itself: E.g., I don’t want to donate so I focus on my impact being a share of the overwhelming need (which I might opportunistically define broadly) to conclude that helping is futile.\nNote (unfold)…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nBG: My thought was that people who do not value saving lives (or are in general unwilling to contribute to it or oppose policies spending money on foreign aid for some other reason, e.g. prejudice) exercise a form of motivated reasoning to justify this (perhaps in a nonstandard way). They choose to reason according to the ‘proportional’ standard in order to conclude that it is not worth mdonating to these causes because ‘the scope of the problem is too large and they will never be completely solved’. I suggest that people apply this reasoning to problems specifically when they do not want to take action to address these problems. (In contrast, in domains where they do want to make a change, they may use a different, more marginal and 'consistent' sort of reasoning.) E.g., (to be stereotypical) imagine a MAGA person who wants to end foreign aid because \"Africa will always have endless problems\" but who wants to impose restrictions on abortion (even knowing millions of abortions will continue to occur) because \"every unborn life matters.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo operationalize this, we need to define what the numerator and denominator represent. For the numerator, an (EA) impact-driven ‘individualist’ donor might consider the impact of her own contribution (per dollar or overall) relative to the size of the need. In contrast, a more collectivist/team-reasoning/communitarian thinker might consider the impact of the total expected donation relative to the size of the need. We also need to better define the denominator: how do individuals lump together different groups/problems to define the overall scale of the need, and how sensitive is this to the fundraisers’ framing?\n\n\n11.3.3 Mechanisms\nFetherstonhaugh et al. (1997) highlight “Weber’s law”: Humans are sensitive to proportional changes/proportional differences in stimuli (loudness, brightness, etc); thus we are less sensitive to small changes relative to a larger baseline. There is evidence this also holds in assessing losses of life. … the “subjective value of saving the specified number of lives is greater for a smaller tragedy than for a larger one” .\nBaron (1997) attributes PD to quantity confusion and classifies this as “contamination by an irrelevant factor”; more generally, this could be seen in terms of innumeracy.\nThis may lead to a lower willingness to contribute to a problem when the apparent scale (or “denominator”) of the problem is larger (e.g., more lives at risk), holding constant the benefit per dollar contributed (cost per life saved). The perceived scale of the problem may depend on how it is framed by fundraisers, charities, and the media. However, this may not be completely manipulable: e.g., massive global problems may not be easy to “frame down.” “Loewenstein and Small (2007) suggested that the PDE is driven by increased sympathy towards the victims when one can help a large proportion of the victim reference-group.” – A. Erlandsson et al. (n.d.)\n\n\n11.3.4 EG Relevance3\nThis effect represents a general departure from appropriate assessment of the marginal benefit (per cost) of a particular charity/intervention. Thus, this is a general barrier to accurate assessment of effectiveness ergo a barrier to effective giving.\nIn addition, it might be argued that more effective interventions (e.g., targeting poor Africans versus US poverty) may tend to address problems that are inherently larger in scale and magnitude. These may be intrinsically harder to “frame down”, implying EG will suffer more from this bias.\n\n\n11.3.5 State of Evidence4\n\nFetherstonhaugh et al. (1997)\nFetherstonhaugh et al. (1997) (notes HERE)\nMethods\nRange of hypothetical scenariae and evaluations, within-subject manipulations only (with clear contrasts), framed as aid/targeting not charitable donations, standard (mostly Economics) student subject pools.\nThese authors conducted survey experiments on standard (fairly small sample?) student participants. They presented a variety of hypothetical scenariae (e.g., “imagine themselves as a government official of a small, developing country”…), asking for ratings, rankings, etc.\n\nFindings\n\nStudies 1 and 2 found that an intervention saving a fixed number of lives was judged significantly more beneficial when fewer lives were at risk overall. Study 3 found that respondents wanted the minimum number of lives a medical treatment would have to save to merit a fixed amount of funding to be much greater for a disease with a larger number of potential victims than for a disease with a smaller number.\n\nEvaluation of paper’s evidence:\nStrengths: Reasonably realistic frames, (mostly) consistent results across a variety of frames\n\nLimitations: Hypothetical, framed, nonrepresentative, and does not directly address own contributions\n\n\nWithin-subject treatments here:\nBenefit: allow estimation of heterogeneous responses,\nMixed pro and con: highlight the difference in denominators/proportions, making them salient; but this might also be expected to be an inhibitor of this (seemingly non-rational) effect, especially for the Economics-trained sample\n\n\nStatistical tests (ANOVA) appear strong and highly significant in most cases, but further investigation warranted (e.g., pre-registration? Evidence of specification fishing and MHT?)\n\n\nReplication evidence: Mixed, not strongly supported; see Ziano et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\nArvid Erlandsson, Björklund, and Bäckström (2015) (Study 4)\n\nThe PDE-ad was in part based on text from the homepage of a well-known global charity organization focusing on poverty in developing countries. Participants read about Polio and were told that if receiving the expected amount of private donations, it would be possible to vaccinate children so the death rate would decrease by approximately 500 children per year. In the large reference-group version, participants read that 60,000 children in Africa annually die from Polio so the project had a potential rescue proportion of 0.83%. In the small reference-group version, partici pants read that around 500 children in Botswana annually die from Polio so the project had a potential rescue proportion of more than 99%.\n…followed by eight questions about participants’ reactions towards the advertisement. The suggested mediators (distress, sympathy, perceived impact and perceived responsibility) were measured with two questions each\n…after reading and responding to the three ads, participants were told that thanks to their participation, 10 Swedish Kronor (SEK) (1.50 USD) would be donated to charity. The participants were asked to allocate the money between the three organizations by writing an amount (0–10) after each ad and the sum had to be 10 SEK\n…All participants read either one ad from the low end of the effects (statistical victim, large reference-group, out-group victims) plus two ads from the high end of the effects (identified victim, small reference-group, in-group victims) or two ads from the low end plus one ad from the high end.\n[Results]\nParticipants who read the PDE-ad in the small reference-group version had higher helping intentions (M = 3.77, SD = 1.64) than participants who read the large reference-group version, M = 3.46, SD = 1.57; t(430) = 2.01, p = .045. However, participants who read the small reference-group version did not write that they would donate more money if asked (Mean rank = 213.68) than participants who read the large reference-group version (Mean rank = 218.31; Mann–Whitney U = 22720.50, Z = 0.40, p = .686). Despite this, participants who read the small reference-group version allocated more money to the organization distributing Polio- vaccines (M = 4.30 SEK, SD = 2.85) than the participants who read the large reference-group version, M = 3.50 SEK, SD = 2.87; t(430) = 2.91, p = .004. Although not perfectly consistent between the different outcome variables, the results suggest that we replicated the PDE.\n\nEvaluation of evidence (Study 4):\nStrengths: Realistic charity frame, reasonable implementation of small/large “reference group” frames, outcomes record both intentional/attitudinal and actual (small) donation measures\nLimitations: A choice among charities only\nStatistical tests -\nBrief on tangential papers (non charity) and papers supporting the mechanism\nBaron (1997): “Confusion of Relative and Absolute Risk in Valuation”\nMethods\nHypothetical willingness to pay (wtp) questions. Within-subject manipulations only; standard student subject pools, small samples.5\nS1: Questions about (hypothetical wtp for components of government government health insurance. “[Denominator] people die from this disease each year. Their average age is 60. How much are you willing to pay to cover a treatment that will save the lives of [Numerator] of these people?”… (Numerator=90 or 900; Denominator=100, 1000, or 10,000), all combinations presented to all participants.\nS2: Set of causes, each gave wtp for a government program for a 5% reduction in that cause of death and for saving 2,600 lives, also rating prevalence and importance. He reports a very high correlation between wtp by these two measures, an “insensitivity to quantity”, and both wtp measures are higher when subjects report a higher prevalence (even controlling for stated importance).\nEvaluation of paper’s evidence: This evidence appears highly limited. There is some evidence that denominators matter when they (arguably) should not, and participants show confusion between proportions and absolute amounts. The second experiment is highly cognitively demanding and participants have no strong incentive to “get this right.” The first experiment has arguable confounds: e.g., one might question the scientific credibility of the treatment that (claims to) save only a small number of lives out of a very large population. The evidence does not seem to offer much strength over and above the Fetherstonhaugh paper. I also found much of the statistical reporting to be incomplete or unclear, especially for study two. In general, this is, at its best, evidence of quantitative confusion which may go in either direction in any given context.\nIt is also detached from the charity realm, considering the domain of government expenditure and benefits that will accrue to the participant him or herself. For this reason, I listed it is tangential evidence and not charity specific evidence.\nJenni and Loewenstein (1997) Provides support for the “reference group effect” (proportional dominance) as an explanation for the identifiable victims bias.

    "section": "11.4 Statistical/identifiable victim effect {#statvictim}6",
    "text": "11.4 Statistical/identifiable victim effect {#statvictim}6\n\n11.4.1 Definition\nThe identifiable victim effect (IVE) is credited as being first developed by Schelling (1968), who argue “there is a distinction between an individual and a statistical life”. People may react differently towards victims when these victims are identified rather than anonymous (Small and Loewenstein 2003). As a result, resources may be more likely to be devoted to causes where individual victims are more prominent and identifiable (rather than cases where we only see large, unidentified groups) (Small 2010). Slovic (2007) also discussed this effect; this paper derives its title from a quote attributed to Mother Teresa:\n\nIf I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one I will.\n\n7\n\n\n11.4.2 Relevance to effective giving\nBaron and Szymanska (2011) discuss how the IVE could pose a problem for effective altruism, suggesting two reasons that this could be considered a bias.8\nFirstly, they suggest that when altruism is increased for identified victims, this could result in less altruism for those who are not identified,\\(^{(?)}\\)9\nThe latter group may include those most in need of help (such as large groups of people who are severely deprived). Kogut and Ritov (2011) similarly argued that the IVE could yield less efficiency given that it is improbable that the benefits to society will be maximized when more resources are given to victims who are identified than those who aren’t. (This essentially restates our general efficiency argument above, in section @ref(quant-biases)).\n\nBaron and Szymanska (2011) offer a counter-argument:\n\nPerhaps, though, the emotion changes the benefit/cost threshold for altruism, meaning that people are willing to incur a greater personal cost of helping, even when the amount of benefit to others does not change. This shift in the benefit/cost threshold might possibly even increase overall altruism.\n\n\n\nThis could be interpreted as\n\n‘Those internal factors that cause a bias towards identified victims also lead to greater regard for others and thus more giving (’donation bundle Y’), even if it is less efficient. In net this could potential yield a greater good.’ OR\n“Presenting and depicting identified victims leads to … potential yielding a greater good”\n\nIn either case, we can still see the IVE as leading to inefficient giving. From the point of view of the individual before he/she has been ‘triggered by identifiability’, ‘donation bundle Y’ is excessive as well as inefficient (the same benefit could be achieved at less expense or more good at the same expense). Ex-post, after she has been ‘triggered’ to be more generous, we can still see that more social good could have been done given her expenditure.\n\nBaron and Szymanska (2011) also argue that the IVE could be viewed as a framing effect: the choices the donors make are influenced by how the information is presented, holding reality constant. This is about presentation: all victims could be identified, with names, ethnicities and ages. This leads Baron and Szymanska (2011) to suggest that “the identifiability effect may fail a simpler test of rationality”.10\n\n\n\n\n11.4.3 Evidence: Meta-analysis and reviews/surveys\nLee and Feeley (2016a): Meta-analysis\n\nA random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to determine the overall weighted effect of IVE. Overall, 41 studies were included. Results indicated an overall significant yet modest IVE (r = .05). In addition, findings showed that IVE appears reliable mainly when there is a single identified or a single unidentified victim, and/or when study characteristics include elements of the following: a photographed child suffering from poverty, bearing little responsibility for the need, and/or associated with monetary requests.\n\nSee also, the discussion in Kogut and Ritov (2011)\n\nSpecific papers, discussion\n\nOne of the potential reasons that identified victims could elicit greater generosity is that their stories can involve more sympathy-inducing information.**\n\n11\n\nHowever, while sympathy-inducing information may contribute to the impact of the identifiable victim effect, some evidence suggests that it may not be the sole factor driving this. Small and Loewenstein (2003) designed studies to separate the effect of the identification of a victim from the effect of information being provided about a victim. They outlined this distinction as follows:\n\nAlthough it has been claimed that people care about identifiable more than statistical victims, demonstrating this “identifiable victim effect” has proven difficult because identification usually provides information about a victim, and people may respond to the information rather than to identification per se. We show that a very weak form of identifiability - determining the victim without providing any personalizing information - increases caring.\n\nIn one of their studies, they used a version of the “dictator game”. In dictator games, the first player, known as the ‘allocator’ is given an endowment. They then make a unilateral decision on how they should split this endowment. The second player, known as the ‘recipient’, has to accept this split.12\nThere were two conditions in the slightly-altered dictator game devised by Small and Loewenstein (2003). In the ‘determined’ condition, allocators were given a number to link them with the recipient before they made their decision, while in the ‘undetermined’ condition they were linked after the decision. Their hypothesis, that an allocator would give more money to recipients in the determined condition, was supported. Subjects gave significantly more to those victims who had been determined before the allocation. The mean donation for an undetermined victim was USD 2.12, compared to USD 3.42 for determined victims.\nThe second study from @Small and Loewenstein (2003) was a field experiment with the following methodology:\n\n… potential donors were presented with a letter requesting money to buy materials for a house that was to be built for a needy family through the Habit for Humanity organization. The letter described several families on the waiting list to move into homes. Identifiability was manipulated by informing respondents that the family either “has been selected” or “will be selected” from the list. In neither condition were respondents told which family had been or would be selected; the only difference between conditions was in whether the decision had already been made.\n\nAs in their first study, they found evidence supporting their hypothesis that contributions would be larger when the recipients had already been determined. Mean, median and modal donations were all larger in the determined condition, with a mean of USD 2.93 given in the determined family condition, and a mean of USD 2.33 given in the undetermined family condition. This study could arguably provide stronger support for the identifiable victim effect impacting altruism, as Small and Loewenstein (2003) suggest:\n\nBy moving out of the laboratory, we eliminated potential artifacts such as the concern that students might have felt of being “found out” by their peers or other non-empathatic motives. By collecting money for a real charity to help people truly in need, we illustrate the real world implications of this effect.\n\nBoth of these studies from Small and Loewenstein (2003) suggest that identifying a victim, even without providing additional information, can potentially increase giving.\nResults from Charness and Gneezy (2008) similarly offer support for the IVE from dictator games. In their dictator game, they found that when the family name of the recipient was revealed, the allocator gave a significantly larger portion (50 percent more) of their endowment.\nKogut and Ritov (2005a) also studied the IVE with the following design for participants:\n\nThey were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions. Two factors were varied between subjects in a 2 x 4 factorial design: the singularity of the victim (single vs. a group of eight individuals) and the identifying information (unidentified; age only; age & name; age, name, & picture)\n\nParticipants were given the same story, describing either a sick child, or a group of eight sick children. They were then asked if they would donate, and if so, how much they would donate.\nTheir first finding was that “the effect of identification may be largely restricted to single victims”, as the impact of being identified was significantly less for the group of eight children than for the single child. Secondly, they found that “the identification of the single victim is more effective the more vivid the representation”, with willingness to donate at its highest when the victims were identified by age, name, and picture.13\nSudhir, Roy, and Cherian (2016) also found support for the IVE. They randomized advertising content in a large-scale experiment with charitable mailings across India. In the ‘individual’ condition, they described an individual along with her photograph. On the ‘group’ condition they described the victims as a group of four women and used a photo collage. They found an average donation rate of 0.24% in the individual condition, compared to 0.09% for the group condition. They also found that the IVE contributed both to a higher rate of giving, and higher amounts given.\nLinked to the identifiable victim effect is the notion that people are sensitive to the proportion of lives saved, rather than absolute lives (as discussed in more detail above) (Baron 1997; Fetherstonhaugh et al. 1997; Small, Loewenstein, and Slovic 2007). Loewenstein and Small (2007) suggest that if the proportion of lives saved is higher, then the lives could be more identifiable, resulting in more sympathy. They claim that, for example, “Ten lives out of a group of 100 is a high proportion and thus more sympathy inducing than 10 lives out of 1,000,000”. Loewenstein and Small (2007) also argue that the IVE represents one extreme on a continuum. If a single victim is identified, this victim becomes part of one’s own reference group; thus one might experience higher levels of sympathy. At the opposite end of the continuum we find the ‘drop-in-the-bucket’ effect, where “there are so many victims in the reference group that the individual victims are hidden among the masses”.\nLee and Feeley (2016b) present a random-effects meta-analysis of the IVE, including 41 studies. They find*\n\nTo do: check the extent to which these studies surround charitable giving.\n\n\nan overall significant yet modest IVE (r = .05) … reliable mainly when there is a single identified or a single unidentified victim, and/or when study characteristics include elements of the following: a photographed child suffering from poverty, bearing little responsibility for the need, and/or associated with monetary requests."

    "section": "11.5 Availability heuristic",
    "text": "11.5 Availability heuristic\n\n11.5.1 Definition and relevance\nThe availability heuristic suggests that people judge the frequency of classes, or the probability of events, by the ease with which they come to mind (Tversky and Kahneman 1973). I.e., people may treat an event a as more likely than an event b, if a comes to mind more easily than b (Angner 2012).\nAs a result of people using the availability heuristic, they may underestimate the prevalence of–and place less value on–problems such as extreme poverty. These problems may be less salient than issues people in developed countries regularly encounter. For example, many of us have personal experiences with cancer. As well as potentially inducing more sympathy (see here for more on sympathy biases), this could lead us to that people place disproportionately high value on curing cancer relative to, e.g., preventing malaria. Tversky and Kahneman (1973) discussed how personal experience can influence judgments of probability in their original paper on the availability heuristic:\n\nPerhaps the most obvious demonstration of availability in real life is the impact of the fortuitous availability of incidents of scenarios. Many readers must have experienced the temporary rise in the subjective probability of an accident after seeing a car overturned by the side of the road… Continued preoccupation with an outcome may increase its availability, and hence its perceived likelihood.\n\n\nKahneman (2011) also looks at studies from Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1981b), Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1981a), and Lichtenstein et al. (1978), summarising:\n\nStrokes cause almost twice as many deaths as all accidents combined, but 80% of respondents judged accidental deaths to be more likely Tornadoes were seen as more frequent killers than asthma, although the latter cause 20 times more deaths Death by disease is 18 times more likely as accidental death, but the two were judged about equally likely\n\nKahneman (2011) concludes:\n\nThe lesson is clear: estimates of death are warped by media coverage. The coverage itself is biased toward novelty and poignancy. The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but are also shaped by it\n\n\nThe availability heuristic could translate to more effective charities being neglected. For example, in the UK, cancer is a very prominent charitable cause, and Cancer Research UK is one of the UK’s most popular charities. This is in spite of the fact, per-dollar, Cancer Research is appears significantly less effective than several anti-malaria charities Macaskill (2015).14\nMacaskill (2015) has also discussed how we should compare malaria and cancer as issues (unfold):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nMacaskill:\n\nEvery year cancer kills 8.2 million people and is responsible for 7.6 percent of all deaths and ill health worldwide (measured in terms of QALYs lost). USD 217 billion per year is spent on cancer treatment. Malaria is responsible for 3.3 percent of QALYs lost worldwide. In terms of its health impacts, cancer is about twice as bad as malaria, so if medical spending were in proportion to the scale of the problem, we would expect malaria treatment to receive about USD 100 billion per year. In reality only USD 1.6 billion per year is spent on malaria treatment: about sixty times less than we would expect.\n\n\nCancer treatment receives so much more funding than malaria treatment because malaria is such a cheap problem to solve that rich countries no longer suffer from it. (It was eliminated in the US in 1951.) The fact that cancer treatment receives so much more funding than malaria treatment means that, on the margin, each of us can provide a far greater benefit for other people by funding the most effective malaria treatments in the developing world than we can by funding the most effective cancer treatments in the developed world.\n\n\n\n\nMost people in developed countries like the US and the UK will have an experience with cancer over their lifetime, either personally or through a loved one.15\nIn contrast, while malaria it receives some international coverage, was eliminated in the US in the 1950s.\nIf cancer is more visible, it could be more salient,leading people to overestimate its importance through their use of the availability heuristic.16\n\n\n11.5.2 Connection to other biases\nThis ‘availability’ bias is distinct from the idea that are more likely to donate to cancer research out of self-interest (i.e. thinking that it may help them personally); the latter is discussed in section @ref(self-interest).\nAvailability has some links to other biases we consider. Salience contributes to probability estimations, and events that come to mind more easily can be judged as more likely. Thus, this could be a mechanism behind other biases, such as the identifiable victim effect and the lack of attention given to distant future causes. Angner (2012) discusses the link between the availability heuristic and vivid stories (with vividness discussed as a potential contributor to both the IVE and distant future issues):\n\nThe availability heuristic sheds light on the power of storytelling. As every writer knows, stories are often far more compelling than scientific data. If you doubt that, just ask a wolf. Wolves pose a trivial danger to humans: the number of verifiable, fatal attacks by wolves on humans is exceedingly low. And yet, fear of wolves runs deep. Part of the explanation is certainly that there are so many stories about big, bad wolves eating, e.g., little girls’ grandmothers. As a result of these stories, the idea of wolves attacking humans is highly salient, which means that people treat it as likely – even though the data establish it is not. Far more dangerous organisms, such as the Salmonella bacterium that kills some 400 people each year in the US alone, do not figure in the public imagination in the same way and consequently are not as feared as they probably should be. The power of storytelling can be harnessed to communicate risk communication very effectively, but it can also do immense harm. A single story about an illegal immigrant committing a heinous crime can generate strong anti-immigration sentiments in spite of evidence of the beneficial welfare effects of immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.3 Evidence (to do)"

    "section": "11.6 Diversification heuristic",
    "text": "11.6 Diversification heuristic\nBaron and Szymanska (2011) suggest that, in many contexts, diversification can often be beneficial. For example, when it comes to experiences, diversification can mean variety, helping to reduce the likelihood of adaption and things being repeated. This comes from the idea of diminishing marginal utility, and Read and Loewenstein (1995) explain the classical model of variety seeking as follows:\n\nAccording to the classical model, variety seeking arises from object-specific satiation or the diminishing rate of marginal return to consumption [of an individual good]. According to this view, the optimal bundle of goods contains variety because the benefit from an additional unit of a specific good (i.e., its marginal return) decreases as a function of the number of units of that good one already possesses.\n\n\n\n\nDavid Reinstein: The classical economics model does not assert a diminishing rate of marginal return to consumption as a general universal property. It is recognized that this may not hold over all goods for all quantities and all individuals.\n\nHowever, this (as well as the more rigorous concepts of ‘convex’ preferences or ‘quasi-concave’ upper-contour sets) are\n\nConvenient for the maths/proofs, allowing continuous responses to prices, etc.\nIntuitively (and perhaps empirically) justified in many contexts.\nA reasonable way of explaining why individuals do not ‘spend their money on a single good’.\n\n\n\n\nDiversification can particularly have value in investing, where it can reduce the exposure to risk (variance) for a given expected return (or increase the expected return for a given expected variance of the return. (See ‘diversification’, ‘asset pricing’ and the CAPM model, in standard textbooks.)\n\n\nHowever, people may continue to diversify even in domains where this no longer makes sense, as they use diversification heuristics. The causes of diversification heuristics more broadly are discussed in detail by Read and Loewenstein (1995). A study by Benartzi and Thaler (2007) is also useful for examining the evidence of diversification heuristics more widely, particularly for establishing what they refer to as the “\\(1/n\\) rule”. The \\(1/n\\) rule was inspired by the tendency for people to sometimes split allocations evenly across their options:\n\nNobel laureate Harry Markowitz, one of the founders of modern portfolio theory, confessed: “I should have computed the historic covariances of the asset classes and drawn an efficient frontier. Instead, . . . I split my contributions fifty–fifty between bonds and equities” (Zweig 1998). Markowitz was not alone. During the period when TIAA-CREF had only two options—TIAA invests in fixed income securities and CREF invests in equities—more than half the participants had selected a fifty–fifty split. Markowitz’s strategy can be viewed as naive diversification: when faced with “n” options, divide assets evenly across the options. We have dubbed this heuristic the “1/n rule.”17\n\n\n\nImplications and causes of diversification heuristics in charitable giving\nFor the rest of this section, we will focus on the implications and causes of diversification heuristics as they relates to charitable giving specifically, but the above studies are valuable for further examining the underlying causes behind diversification heuristics in general.\nOne study that offers some evidence for people diversifying when this is no longer effective comes from a study examining how people chose to distribute screening tests for colon cancer, by Ubel et al. (1996), who used the following method:\n\nWe asked prospective jurors, medical ethicists, and experts in medical decision making to choose between two screening tests for a population at low risk for colon cancer. One test was more cost effective than the other but because of budget constraints was too expensive to be given to everyone in the population. With the use of the more effective test for only half the population, 1100 lives could be saved at the same cost as that of saving 1000 lives with the use of the less effective test for the entire population.\n\nThey found that 56 percent of the prospective jurors, 53 percent of the medical ethicists, and 41 percent of the experts chose the less effective test. The authors report that most defended this choice on the basis of valuing equity, leading Ubel et al. (1996) to conclude that “People place greater emphasis on equity than is reflected by cost-effectiveness analysis”. While this study is not on charitable giving directly, it may have implications in understanding how people may view trade-offs in equity and efficiency, particularly where real human lives are at stake.\nFox, Ratner, and Lieb (2005) also expanded on a problem linked to diversification, which they refer to as partition dependence. This builds on the finding that people can often split allocations evenly across options (Benartzi and Thaler 2007). They discuss the distinction between the two ideas:\n\nIf a decision maker subjectively partitions the option set in different ways on different occasions, then choices and allocations will vary systematically with these partitions. We refer to this phenomenon as partition dependence. To illustrate, suppose that a philanthropist intent on donating to an array of children’s charities is presented with a set of organizations that are grouped by whether they are domestic or international. She may decide to diversify fully across these two categories by allocating half of her donation to domestic charities and half to international charities. However, suppose instead that she is presented with the same set of organizations, grouped into local charities, national charities, and international charities. In this case, the philanthropist may allocate two thirds to domestic charities (one third to local, one third to national) and one third to international charities. Note that partition dependence differs from diversification heuristics such as the “1/n rule,” documented by Benartzi and Thaler (2007), in which people spread their retirement savings evenly across the n investment instruments that were offered (e.g., stock fund, bond fund.) The 1/n rule refers to the tendency to spread savings evenly among investment options with little regard to the particular investments that are offered; partition dependence refers to the tendency to make different allocations among the same set of options as a function of the way those options are subjectively grouped.\n\nIn one of their studies to examine partition dependence, Fox, Ratner, and Lieb (2005) recruited participants and told them that the researchers would donate $2 on behalf of each participant to United Way charities (a charity which includes funds that benefit both international projects and local communities). The participants could choose how to allocate the funds, and were told the following:\n\nIn particular, you can allocate the United Way donation into international funds (which the United Way would then allocate to more specific funds abroad) and/or Durham County funds (including programs benefiting seniors, programs nurturing our young children, programs promoting health and wellness, and programs strengthening our families).\n\nThe study had two conditions in order to examine the potential impacts of partition dependence, non-hierarchical and hierarchical:\n\nParticipants in the nonhierarchical partition condition (n = 15) were then asked to indicate their proposed allocation to international funds and each of four Durham County funds, with the order identical to that listed in the preceding paragraph. Respondents were asked to indicate percentages and were reminded to make sure that their allocation summed to 100%. Participants in the hierarchical partition condition (n = 16) were told, “Below we will ask you to first allocate geographically, then to more specific funds.” Next they were asked to indicate how much of the money they would donate to (superordinate categories of) international funds versus Durham County funds and were reminded to make sure that their allocation summed to 100%. Finally, these participants were asked to indicate how they would allocate their Durham County donation among each of the four possibilities.\n\nTheir results suggested that there was evidence for partition dependence in participants:\n\nThe mean donation to the international fund was 55% in the hierarchical condition (n = 16) but only 21% in the nonhierarchical condition (n = 15), t(29) = 3.73, p = .0004, one-tailed. In fact, median donations were 50% in the hierarchical condition and 20% in the nonhierarchical condition—the precise proportions one would expect if participants applied pure partition-dependent diversification without adjustment.\n\nIf people do use diversification heuristics in charitable domains, as these studies from Ubel et al. (1996) and Fox, Ratner, and Lieb (2005) suggest, this could have significant implications for the extent to which people give effectively. While diversifying could have some value, and may make some sense if people are uncertain about the outcomes of their giving, Baron and Szymanska (2011) outline ‘why the usual arguments for diversification are less likely to apply for charitable giving’:\n\nThe marginal benefit per dollar (recall the difference between the average vs. marginal benefit) of some support is usually much higher than the marginal benefit of support in addition to some other previous support. In the context of charitable donations, however, a single donor does not have much influence over the total level of the charity’s income (unless the donor is a major philanthropist). Thus, the usual arguments that favour diversification in investments do not necessarily apply to donations by typical donors. For charities, the focus should be on maximizing the expected increase in the economic welfare per dollar of every contribution… In reality, however, more often than not, each contributor has only a tiny effect on the total funding required by a charitable organization, so the argument based on the principle of declining marginal utility is unlikely to apply. We should, therefore, identify a charity with the highest expected benefit per dollar, and make our entire contribution to that one charity.\n\n\n\nIn other words, a donor may err by thinking and acting as if she were the only donor to the charities that she supports. If she were, then it would make sense to diversify because of the principle of declining marginal utility just described. In reality, however, more often than not, each contributor has only a tiny effect on the total funding required by a charitable organization, so the argument based on the principle of declining marginal utility is unlikely to apply.\n\n\nWe should, therefore, identify a charity with the highest expected benefit per dollar, and make our entire contribution to that one charity.\n\n\nDR: There are some perspectives under which a certain amount diversification in charitable giving, motivated by a form of risk-aversion, may be optimising, at least for an individual with particular other-regarding preferences. For example, suppose:\n\n… an individual donor values the impact that she actually has in terms of realized outcomes (rather than valuing her ‘expected value impact’), and …\nshe gains diminishing returns to this impact (making her, in a sense ‘risk-averse’)\n\nThis would imply that, if she is maximising her expected utility (a standard assumption in Economics):\n\nshe would strictly prefer to have (e.g.) a 100% chance of saving one life over a 50% chance of saving two lives, and\nshe would strictly prefer to have a 10% chance of saving one life over a 5% chance of saving two lives, and\nshe might strictly prefer to have a 10% chance of saving 100 lives over a 5% chance of saving 201 lives.\n\nConsider the probabilities that each dollar donated to a charity (leads to an intervention that) saves a life (or achieves a particular outcome). Suppose these outcomes (the lives saved) are not perfectly correlated across charities. In such a case, this an individual would find it optimal to diversify her giving across equally-impactful charities, and potentially even to include some ‘slightly less impactful’ charities in her ‘giving bundle.’\n\n\n\n\nEvidence for diversification heuristic in charitable giving (to do)"

    "text": "11.7 Overhead aversion\n\nRelated Terms\n\nSimilar terms: Overhead bias\nPossible mechanisms: waste aversion, perfectionism; evaluability bias (for this versus other metrics); excuse-driven/motivated reasoning\nDistinct but related: corruption aversion\n\n\n\nDescription\nPotential donors may have a negative feeling towards a charity’s costs that are considered “overhead” rather than “direct spending on program activities.” This may make them reluctant to donate to charities that express a high “overhead ratio” and/or when they believe their donation will go to “pay for overhead”, and to favor instead charities that report low “overhead ratios”.\nDiscussion: There are some clear flaws in this logic (thus we may call it “overhead bias”): many things considered overhead are fixed or sunk costs which will not be changed by the amounts donated; thus, at the margin the donation may not actually go towards this overhead.\nMarginal overhead is also possible. Suppose, e.g., the cost of an additional year of school tuition fees for a child are £200, but this requires an additional administrative cost of £50 to vet the student and her family, pay money transfer fees, fill out additional forms, etc. A donation of £200 earmarked for “tuition only” would require an additional £50 of these costs, which might be labled “overhead”. However, as this example suggests, many such “overhead” expenses are necessary parts of the mission, an increase its effectiveness (e.g., training employees, auditing, evaluating and targeting programs). On the other hand, we cannot rule out that in some cases high overhead might be a signal of inefficient practices. Where organizations have bloated annual operating expenses it might be more efficient for them to close down in the medium term and for that money to be used for leaner charities. (Several theoretical papers (ref: Steinberg 1986 and later work) discuss whether or not the overhead ratios are a sign of efficiency.)\n\n\n\n\n11.7.1 Overview of Evidence\nSurvey and observational evidence suggests that donors focus on potentially misleading measures of overhead. Gneezy, Keenan, and Gneezy (2014) present a credible piece of field-experimental evidence suggesting that having a “lead donor” and framing this as “covering overhead” may increase donations. Metzger and Günther (2019a) lab participants donate (marginally) significantly less when presented with (the option to buy) information about a NGO’s administrative costs (perhaps because such costs were made salient). Caviola et al. (2014) (hypothetical?) experiments suggest that evaluability may drive the focus on overhead rather than effectiveness. Portillo and Stinn (2018) lab participants favored overhead-free charities and preferred fundraising-related to salary-related overhead. Kinsbergen and Tolsma (2013) representative (Dutch) survey participants “have a strong aversion regarding overhead costs, [but]… seem to value the capacities of paid staff members and are, to a certain extent, willing to pay a price for these.”\n\n\n11.7.2 Relevance to effective giving\n\nHow this particular barrier proves problematic for effective giving?\n\nStudies finds ‘no correlation’ between overhead and effectiveness– are these convincing?18\nAs noted above, overhead is an important input to the charity’s production function, enabing it to be effective. A biases against overhead therefore distort’s the donor choice of charity away from effectiveness. The other side of this coin: in an efficient market firms provide the services consumers demand. If consumers have a preference for firms that use a lower share of some input, this will “distort” the production process away from this input, making it seem artificially costly . Similarly, if donors punish charities for excessive overhead, charities will use “too little” of inputs deemed to be overhead.\n\nNote that doing impact evaluation will itself increase overhead. I.e., aversion to overhead will lead people to be biased against evidence-based charities that evaluate their own programs.\nWhile the above concerns do not necessarily tilt against charities targeting overeas or lower-profile causes, it nonetheless represents a departure from efficiency in choice/provision of charitable services.\nFurthermore, there is a reasonable case [todo: get evidence] that working in poor countries, countries that are further from the charity’s headquarters, and countries more distant from legal, financial, and other services will lead to a greater overhead ratio. This may be accentuated if the basic service (e.g., food, housing, or education) is cheaper in poor countries. E.g., sending a poor child in Chicago to a summer enrichment program might cost £4000 in fees and £500 to administer the scholarship, roughly 11% “overhead share” . Sending a poor Ghanaian child for a year might cost £300 plus £100 in administration, a 25% share.\n\n\nState of Evidence; key papers\nMethodological issues\n\nObservational (correlational) studies: Overhead varies across charities in non-random ways; may be correlated to unobservable characteristics. There may also be reverse causality – fundraising expenses both increase reported overhead and (presumably) drive donations.\nMeer (2017) identified plausibly exogenous variation; but this pertained to actual incremental costs/prices, rather than the “overhead” costs at issue\nField experiments can vary presentation or framing of overhead but not (typically) a charity’ actual administration processes (thus “overhead”)\nLab experiments can vary the actual price of giving but this doesn’t represent the real-world “overhead” issue; others\nIn contrast, Metzger and Günther (2019a) varied the charity the subjects could donate to, but imposed a strong framing of the administrative costs as a marginal price).\nSurvey and hypothetical vignette evidence (usual issues)\n\n\nGneezy, Uri, Elizabeth A. Keenan, and Ayelet Gneezy. “Avoiding overhead aversion in charity.” Science 346.6209 (2014): 632-635.|\nGneezy, Keenan, and Gneezy (2014) ran a large-scale (N=40,000 [check]) mail solicitation on behalf of an organization seeking to fund as many US educational projects (each costing $20,000 US) as possible. Recipients were asked to give 20/50/100 USD. They found that framing a lead donation as “covering[ing] all the overhead costs associated with raising the needed donations” lead to a significantly greater share donating and amount raised than either the control condition (no lead donation?) or a seed (“has given this campaign seed money”) or matching frame (“will match every dollar given… up to a total of $10,000”).19\nNote that while the framing differed, the actual treatment of the seed money in each case was the same; unless the charity could change the way it administered its programs between treatment, there is no clear way to experimentally vary the actual overhead.\nThis amounts to a clear piece of evidence that in such contexts framing overhead as being “covered” in this way may increase donations. However, it doesn’t reveal donors’ reaction to the reported measure of overhead itself. The effect may come from the particular salience of the way the lead donor’s (particularly selfless) act is portrayed, or it may be specific to overhead “associated with raising … donations” rather than administrative overhead, salaries, etc.\nThe same authors ran a lab experiment where they were able to vary the share of the subjects’ donation that actually went to the charity, labeling the difference (donation - amount passed) as “overhead”, and in a second treatment arm, whether this “overhead” was covered by a third party. The results were similar to the field experiment [CHECK, go into more detail]. However, this transparent “donation reduction” has little in common with the real-world costs usually depicted as “overhead”. In this lab experiment, a donor who cares about her marginal impact should consider the pass-through rate or “price”; this is not “overhead illusion”.20\n\n\nPortillo, Javier E.; Stinn, Joseph, (2018). “Overhead Aversion: Do Some Types Of Overhead Matter More Than Others?”. Journal Of Behavioral And Experimental Economics, 72, , 40–50.\nPortillo and Stinn (2018) Lab experiment\n\nIf an overhead-free donation is readily available, then the average donor in our experiment (70–80% of subjects) prefers that charity to receive the donation. However, if donations are not overhead-free, most (approximately two-thirds of subjects) prefer the donation go toward fundraising efforts instead of salary-related expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n\nKinsbergen, Sara; Tolsma, Jochem, (2013)\nKinsbergen and Tolsma (2013)\nHypothetical survey (vignettes, scenarios) “We constructed 960 scenarios in which a fictive international development organisation was described. … A large representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 2,758) received six randomly allocated scenarios and had to decide if, and if so, how much they would donate to the depicted (fictive) organisation…. Although donors have a strong aversion regarding overhead costs, we find that donors seem to value the capacities of paid staff members and are, to a certain extent, willing to pay a price for these.\n\n\n\n\nMeer, Jonathan, 2017\nMeer (2017) “Effects of the price of charitable giving: Evidence from an online crowdfunding platform”\n\nDonorsChoose platform involves plausibly exogenous variation in the providing (the same) goods to teachers across projects (varying sales taxes, fullfillment, payment processing fees, etc).[^3] Fees are ‘explicit and salient’.\nRobust analysis (e.g., teacher fixed-effects) to address a potential endogeneity concern (saavy teachers economize on fees)\nAn increased price of giving results in a lower likelihood of a project being funded. We also calculate the price elasticity of giving, finding estimates between −0.8 and −2.\n\nHowever, this does not typify the overhead we are considering. Here, we see variation in the donot’s actual costs of providing outputs; as in Gneezy, Keenan, and Gneezy (2014) lab experiments, this is not “illusion”. While donor responses to e.g., greater fixed costs of maintaining an office in Malawi, or greater costs of identifying legitimately poor families might be similar, we do not know.\\(^+\\)21\n\n\nSolutions (add section)\n\n“Seed donor covering overhead”\n\n\n\nSimultaneous comparisons and evaluation of impact and overhead where relevant Caviola et al.

B. the demand for information about aid impact is lowest, and it is highest for information about the recipient type. C. impact info didn't affect average donation, while information about the exact recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in donation levels.”\n“In the recipient type group, informed participants donated significantly more than uninformed participants because they”rewarded” the preferred recipient with higher-than- average transfers. In the administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly less than uninformed participants because they used the information to “punish” NGOs with high administration costs.”\n“only 28% of the participants in the bought ANY information (impact, who benefits overhead).

    "text": "11.10 Other quantitative biases\n\n11.10.1 “Mistaken Risk aversion or loss aversion”\nThoughts… (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n“Risk aversion with respect to the impact that I make”\nThis would come out of (i.e., would be equivalent to) mazimising a utility function which included an ‘impact term’ with diminishing marginal returns to this impact. This would not in itself be a bias.\nHowever, an individual donor might:\n\nMisunderstand what ‘risk’ means in this context\nMis-percieve the risks/probabilities\nFail to consider that other donors are giving to distinct causes, leading to some automatic diversification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.10.2 Bias towards tangibility (perhaps not ‘quantitative’?)\nIncorporate notes from this comment.\nReprinted in fold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nto make donations sustainable in the large community one might need to think about both - the gains to the ‘beneficiaries’, and - the internal emotional and social benefits for the donor.\nI.e., a ‘two-sided market’. One needs to consider the ‘donor as consumer’. … we might want to consider some reduction in former if it greatly increases the latter.\nThe latter certainly involves tangibility, the feeling of having done something that you can see changes the world in a visible way, ‘agency’, and the feeling of having a particular attachment to somebody you can help. People buy fireworks because they get more pleasure from “lighting fireworks and controlling their direction” than from “seeing a display”.\nThe problem is that the forms of generosity that you can more easily ‘control and see the tangible effects of’ tend to be more local to the wealthy (by global standards) donors, less neglected, and thus less effective at the margin.\nFurthermore, ensuring and enabling this “specific donation” can itself be costly in terms of administration and communication. It can also lead to some departure from ‘giving to the most needy’ if the ‘most needy person’ is harder to communicate with.\nBut I think there is potential to try to harness tangibility and incrementally in the effective giving space.\nThere is the idea of “sponsor an individual child or family or village”. My impression is that many charities in fact do this in their marketing and communication but the actual donations are not directly tied to a particular beneficiaries. And I expect donors realize this. When I spoke with these charities they say that there are both practical and ethical issues making this undoable (see below).\nMy proposal, which seems to overlap what you’re saying, was something like telling people\n\nWe are linking each potential donor to a particular household (or village etc). You are linked to the ZJHGUH household in SHMZPLA.\n\n\nDo you want to donate to provide the ZJHGUH household with education, medicine, and clean water? You are the only potential donor linked to ZJHGUH by our organization.\n\n\nIf you donate to build a new sanitary facility, you will be able to choose which color it is painted, and we’ll send photos\n\nThe idea is close to what are you are suggesting. Furthermore, technology could allow us now to provide some pictures and feedback directly linked to the beneficiary household.\nThe very strong objections to this I have heard:\n\n“This is unethical/unfair to the beneficiary households not targeted”\n“This is too manipulative of potential donors”\n“This would be impossible to implement”\n“This is too ‘white-saviour vs victim’-ish”\n\nThese objections are somewhat reasonable (but some could also be rebutted to an extent) but I suspect that if done right, the benefits will outweigh the costs, in terms of generating substantial amounts of donations (as well as bringing connections between people on both sides of the global divide, which may have additional benefits).\nWhy do I think it could be so effective at motivating donations?\nHumans in general (including the global wealthy) devote huge shares of our income to … - our family - people whom we interact with, and in our community - public goods that we can have a tangible impact on (e.g., fireworks, public art, gardens)\nIf helping the worlds’ poorest people can be made into something that is tangible, incremental, and more ‘direct’ I think it will leverage our innate desires… 1. To help those we feel we have an ‘obligation to’ (because no one else will help them), 2. To have a connection to people whom we can help, and 3. To have agency and see the impact of our actions.\nYou might object to the first point, saying “this is inaccurate … how can you say ‘no one else will help them’” or “how can you link a single donor to a single beneficiary and otherwise deny that beneficiary the opportunity?”\nBut there is a sense in which the standard charity and aid does this anyways, only in a more probablistic sense. We don’t give enough to provide for all the world’s poor. Some are going to be denied opportunities, and an individual donation does make this difference. It’s just that it is not completely traceable.\nBy making it traceable and tangible we may unlock a vast “supply of generosity”.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.10.3 Corruption aversion (perhaps not ‘quantitative’?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic idea\n\n\n\n\n\nA donor might overstate the importance of corruption in determining the effectiveness of a gift. E.g., suppose…\nIntervention A (e.g., bednets in country A): Saves one life, on average, per 5000 USD donated and used. However, for every 1 USD donated, 5 cents must be paid in bribes to enable the bednets to be distributed. Suppose–just for this example–that the paying these bribes has no other negative consequences in the short or long term.23\nIntervention B (e.g., building wells in country B): Saves one life, on average, per 10000 USD donated and used. No bribery is involved.\nClearly, in this artificially constructed example, donations for intervention A are more effective. Even net of the bribes, this will save more lives on average.\nHowever, individuals may be particularly averse to knowing that their donation is used even in some small part to pay bribes, enriching someone unjustly, even though it has a much greater positive affect on others.\nThis is not necessarily a bias, it may be an inherent part of preferences, potentially embodying non-moral-utilitarian deontological concerns. Such a preference would nonetheless lead to ‘inefficient donations’ from the point of view of someone who does not have this concern.\nBut there might also be a bias involved in some cases. Some individuals may not have this inherent distaste for bribery, or may have a distaste for it but still primarily value donating to the most (e.g.) lifesaving-per-dollar cause. However, the silence and visceral repugnance of corruption may cause these individuals to over-estimate its impact on efficiency. (This seems related to the availibility bias.)\nNote: this may be difficult to disentangle from motivated reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngner, Erik. 2012. A Course in Behavioral Economics.

Some of these misconceptions may prove particularly pernicious to effective charitable giving; others may simply lead to “departure from optimization” in giving choices.\nWe considered whether to present these as ‘fundamental barriers’, rather than the results of other fundamental biases and norms. For example:\nFundamentally there are systematic reasons why we might not expect ‘incorrect beliefs that are relevant to charitable donation choices’ to be corrected.

    "text": "13.2 Overcoming the “barriers and biases”\nIn this section, we intend to:\n1. Discuss responses to any barriers presented in previous chapters. Not all barriers have researched solutions, therefore only barriers with responses will be addressed. 2. Outline how the response overcomes this barrier.\n\n13.2.1 De-biasing and misperception correction\nBarrier(s):\nProposed response:\n:\nSee, e.g., (Caviola et al. 2020):\n\nWe found that lay people estimated that among charities helping the global poor, the most effective charities are 1.5 times more effective than the average charity (Studies 1 and 2). Effective altruists, in contrast, estimated the difference to be factor 30 (Study 3) and experts estimated the factor to be 100 (Study 4). We found that participants donated more to the most effective charity, and less to an average charity, when informed about the large difference in cost-effectiveness (Study 5).\nOne possibility is that people conflate overhead with effectiveness, and (probably correctly) think that the difference between charities’ overhead expenditures are relatively modest.\nAnother possibility is that people make a mistaken analogy between charities and for-profits. The difference in price for two similar products is rarely higher than factor 1.5, because market pressures usually lead to cost-effectiveness optimization (Mankiw, 2011).\nYet another possibility is that the misconception about differences in effectiveness between charities is related to another misconception: people’s overestimation of how effective charities are in absolute terms, which we observed in Study 1. Since they believe that an average charity is already extremely effective at saving lives, they might believe that it is simply not possible for the most effective charities to be substantially more effective. This leads to a suppressed estimate of the difference in effectiveness between charities.\n\nBarrier(s): Overhead aversion\nProposed Response: Pre-cover overhead costs. Lead donor funds could be used to “cover overhead”, this increases donation incidence and amounts. (This response is from the tools_public_sample Airtable)\nRelevant work: Gneezy et al., 2014 https://rady.ucsd.edu/docs/faculty/aGneezy/Published%20Papers/Overhead_Science_2014.pdf\n\nBarriers(s): Scope insensitivity\nProposed Response: Unit Asking\nHow does this solution address the barrier?:\n\n\nMake impact more comparable by allowing joint evaluation (Evaluation mode)\nBarrier(s): Effect of analytical (effectiveness) information on generosity and evaluation aversion\nProposed response: Make impact more comparable by allowing joint evaluation. Effective charities could present their (e.g. lifesaving) statistics relative to average or popular charities. Although caution should be taken not to demonize certain charities.\nHow does this response address the barrier?:\nTheory: Evaluability bias\nrelevant work: (Caviola et al. 2014; Kogut and Ritov 2005b, 2005a)\n\n\n13.2.2 Efficacy framings\nBarrier(s): Proportional Dominance Effect\nProposed response: Efficacy framing\nHow does this response address the barrier?: The proportional dominance effect means that individuals will be less willing to donate if the magnitude of the problem is larger. More colloquially, they feel that their donation may be a “drop in the bucket”. Efficacy framing involves helping people to understand that their donations are valuable and do have an impact.\nMichael Justen writes:\n\nEfficacy framings might be particularly suited to increase donation to effective charities. By efficacy framings I mean “letting people know how good the donations to these charities are at solving particular problems/saving lives” or similarly that donations here are the most efficient way known to solve the problem. I’m conceptualizing this similar to Will MacAskill’s common one-liner that “we have a remarkable capacity to do good”\nMost of the research I have seen on efficacy in relation to charitable giving has been on “pseudoinefficacy” - the idea that people are less willing to help one person when they are made aware of the broader scope of people in need that they are not helping. This is different than how I’m thinking of efficacy above, but since many EA charities tackle very big problems, EA charities should be cautious to avoid inspiring feelings of pseudoinefficacy. (Pseudoinefficacy could potentially be a barrier to effective giving).\n\nReinstein:\n\nThe EA movement’s (perhaps strongly grounded) has recently emphasized the far-future, the vast scope of potential humanity, and the expansion of moral circles to potentially-sentient beings. Although the arguments presented are careful and strong, this may be particularly unhelpful in making individual donation decisions feel like a futile “drop-in-the-ocean”.\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Information enhacing to improve the social closeness of the recipient\nBarrier(s): Distance (physical and cultural)\nProposed response: Information Enhancing\nHow does this response address the barrier?: A fundraiser could give information about the potential beneficiaries. This might be used to make them seem socially close, and trigger empathy or the feeling of obligation or community. This could be further developed using VR, which could enable a more visceral reaction. One study found that VR increased donations by between 20% and 62% (Kristofferson et al., 2022).\n\nThis may be a ‘superpower’ because distances mean people perceive lack of closeness, but recent tech enables more visceral and interactive presentation (Skype, VR…) [for effective humanitarian charities]\n\nRelevant evidence: Sudhir et al.

    "text": "13.3 Fundraising approaches and innovations that are particularly suitable for more effective charities\nDo the standard collection of psych/behavioral tools “work” for effective charities (aka ‘EA charities’), or can they be made to do so? Do effective causes have any ‘superpowers’ for any of these? E.g., do such charities and causes have advantages in presenting identifiable victims, offering emotional stimuli, incorporating gift exchange motivations, etc.?\nIn this section we intend to:\n1. Briefly highlight those ‘tools’ that give non-EA charities an advantage, but focus on ‘what is actionable’, and how might lessen or flip that advantage.2\n2. Consider which tools present particular challenges or opportunities for EA charities\n\n13.3.1 Approaches which are particularly suitable for more effective charities\n\n\nUnit asking\nMichael Justen writes:\n\n“Unit asking” might be one strategy well-suited to promote effective giving. The strategy is presented in “Unit Asking: A Method to Boost Donations and Beyond” (Hsee et al. 2013). Basically, you ask people how much they would hypothetically donate to one needy person and then how much they donate to multiple needy people. It is closely related to the well-documented identifiable victim bias… [It is] presented as a way to mitigate scope insensitivity and compassion fade in (Västfjäll and Slovic 2020) by increasing evaluability (related to ‘joint evaluations’ discussed below).\nI think Unit Asking could be used to increase (1) the amount given to effective charities and (2) increase people’s likelihood to donate to a more effective charity over another charity, or more broadly the the intuition behind effectiveness. On (1), effective charities are particularly equipped to introduce a greater number of needy people which could get people to then donate more. On (2), having people recognize how much they value one unit/life and then introducing the differences in how many people the most effective charities vs. less effective charities help could help people recognize why effectiveness is so important (and then hopefully donate more effectively).\n\n(Abramowicz 2004)\n\n\nInformation enhancing\n\n\n13.3.2 Mainstream pproaches which may be not be as suitable for EA charities\n\n\nMaking donations visible to others\nThere is varied evidence that people sometimes donate more when donations are visible. This is an example of reputation-seeking behavior. However, in the barrier “signaling concern for effectiveness/impact versus other values”, evidence is presented that demonstrates that effective altruism may be rewarded. It finds that consequentialist choices lead to less favorable treatment relative to emotionally intuitive choices. Therefore, making donations visible to others may have the opposite effect of virtue signaling, instead damaging an individual’s reputation.\n\n\n13.3.3"

Currently: Common practice for certain international charities close to EA (like the water aid funds tied to bottled water); (Examples: Toms gives shoes/shoes; Warby-Parker glasses/glasses) “buy a pair give a pair”; more generally buy ‘consumption tax’ goods like chocolate.

    "text": "A.2 Git and Github\n\nGit is a version control system which enables users to track changes and progress in coding projects or any files in general. It is particularly useful for collaborating on projects as it provides a useful way to show who has altered which files and when. Users are even able to clone a repository (a folder inside of a project which tracks all changes made) and make changes without affecting the original project. Git also provides a very simple way to keep changes to projects up to date across different operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Installation and configuration of Git can be confusing to the newly-initiated user, Happy Git provides a user friendly tutorial on installing Git, which can be downloaded here.\n\n\nA.2.1 Some key things to know about Git and GitHub\nA brief overview of key functions inside Git (assuming a remote Github repo) including commits, pushes & pulls, forks & branches and pull requests: (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloning a Git repository copies an existing Git repository into your local file space.\nA commit saves the changes made in the current document to the local repository. Specific changes to commit to the remote (online) repo must be specified. This process is made much easier using a program such as Github Desktop rather than the Git code itself (although they do the same thing, and the latter is more flexible).\nA push, pushes all local commits to the online version of this repository, essentially updating the online version of the files, to the version which is stored locally on your device.\nA pull, is used to pull the changes made to the online repository, into the local repository. Thus making the local repository up to date with the remote/online repository.\nCreating a branch allows you to create a separate version of a repository and make changes to this without affecting the master/original repository.\nA pull request then allows you to pull the changes made in a branch over to the master repository, in order to merge the work.\nAs noted, Github Desktop provides a user interface for a more simple and intuitive way to use Git. There are a variety of other interfaces.\n\nGithub can also be integrated into RStudio and into many other tools, such as the Atom text editor.\n\nRepos that are stored on Github can be accessed via a browser at github.com. The Github website itself provides a wide variety of tools, discussed further below under ‘GitHub web page’,\n\n\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub can be a bit confusing. Here are some things that I wish I had known, that took my a while to figure out (unfold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit and Github are not the same thing … (explain)\nA ‘commit’ does not actually change the files in the shared (remote) Github repo; you need to ‘push’ to do that\nAfter ‘pulling’ from the remote repo, you may need to merge changes… (explain)\nYou can have several different ‘branches’ of the same Repo existing at the same time. When you switch to a new ‘branch’ the files you see on your computer will instantly and amazingly change to exactly the files in that branch. But don’t worry, the old branch is not lost.\n… add some more"

The popularity of R is growing in Economics Academia, largely due to the growth of Machine Learning techniques in R as well as the flexibility of the language itself. R makes use of packages which are a collection of functions written in order to achieve specific tasks. Whilst R comes pre-installed with a variety of useful packages, it is often useful to install more, which can be done using the install.packages command.1\n\nIf you like, you can try out R-code in the online tool here:\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio is a programming environment and interface which helps facilitate a variety of tasks such as writing scripts using R (as well as other languages), and building/knitting these into various document formats. RStudio ‘Addins’ can also be extremely useful for things like tracking ‘todos’, adding citations, and formatting code. RStudio can also be configured so as to work seamlessly with Git (more on this later). RStudio can be downloaded here\n\n\nInstalling R and Rstudio should take about 20 minutes.\nHere’s a guide to exactly how to do it."

    "text": "A.4 Markdown and Bookdown\n\nMarkdown is a popular set of formats (really a ‘syntax for specifying output’) for generating and authoring documents. The Rmarkdown format (rmarkdown package) is one flavor of Markdown that works with R to enable ‘dynamic documents’ involving text, data-analysis, and other elements. It can then export your work to a variety of outputs such as html, pdf and word documents. As well as this it can also be used to create webpages, such as the one you are currently reading. The power of Markdown files comes from the way that they are able include/embed code as well as data and tables, which is useful for writing reproducible research and creating websites.\n\nThe Bookdown package was built on the Rmarkdown package, but it adds many features to enable larger and more structured output, particularly ‘web books’ and web sites. As we use it, this these books combine multiple Rmarkdown files, with each such ‘Rmd’ file becoming its own HTML page.2\n\n\nstackedit.io can help you practice your markdown, or work on it in a nearly-WYSIWYG environment.\nTo work on the files in a github archive directly in stackedit.io:\n\nMake sure you are a member of the archive\nGo to https://stackedit.io/app#\nClick the “#” in the upper right corner\nClick ‘synchronise’ and add your github account\nClick ‘open from github’\nFill in the url for the github repo, e.g., https://github.com/daaronr/ea_giving_barriers/,\n\nand the (folder and) file you want to edit, such as README.MD) (Not sure if rmd works; gotta check)\n\n\nIt should then come out with two panels. Left panel=code, right panel=output in a nice format, auto-updating. You can open one, close the other, etc., and there are lots of tips/tools.\nHitting ‘synchronise’ should push your changes to the Github repo (but doublecheck this is working)"

This is (or should be) synchronised with all the other repos.\n\n\nA tip: ‘find in files’\n‘Find in files’ is a nice tool when working in Rstudio for a project combining many files.\nIn menu bar, select: - Edit - Find in files…\nOr use the (built in?) shortcut (in Mac) <Shift>-<cmd>-f\n\n\nA.6.1 Basic (R-)Markdown\n\nThe Markdown format offers a simple plain-text notation for specifying the elements of documents, reports, web sites, etc. (It is much simpler and easier to read than html, latex, etc.) It is widely used by programmers, on comment boards/forums, and throughout the internet. For example, GitHub.com automatically renders markdown code, particularly in readme.md files.3\nMarkdown documents are usually saved as plain text files with the extension .md, e.g., report.md. These allow for an easy way to create a variety of outputs, particularly reports and text-focused web pages. The markdown format is converted into other formats (html, latex, etc.) with a variety of tools, particularly something called Pandoc.\n\nWhat is Pandoc?\nPandoc is a tool (a program) for converting from one document format to another. It is incredibly powerful. The great thing about a format like markdown, or r-markdown, is that it is simple to write and peruse, and, with the help of Pandoc, it can convert into many many other useful formats for web pages, documents, presentations, etc.\nPandoc is built into other tools including the RMarkdown package (see discussion on Stackexchange here).\nYou can also install and use Pandoc directly in the command line, or try it out (in a limited but still useful way) on the web here\nFor more on Pandoc visit pandoc.org\n\nIn the R (statistically focused) language there are tools such as knitR that allow R users to produce reports combining text, statistical output, and interactive content. These are generally written in “R-markdown” documents, saved as .Rmd rather than .md files. The R-studio interface, and several “add-ins”, also help facilitate this. This interface is very useful; in fact, it may be convenient to build web books and other content using this even if you are not planning to extensively integrate R code and data. (As in the present book, although I’m hoping to build this in).\nUsing R-markdown and Knitr (and other tools and add-ins like ‘Bookdown’) content from multiple sources can easily be embedded into these documents allowing users to easily display objects such as plots or regression output.\n\n\nA.6.2 Some simple markdown rules\nText can be made italic using single asterisks *italic or bold by using asterisks **bold**.\nHashtags/pound signs (#) specify headers and subheaders, e.g., this third-level subsection header was created with the code:\n### Some simple markdown rules {#simple-md-rules}\nWhere the bit in the curly braces allows us to link-back with the code [link back text whatever](#simple-md-rules) … rendering as link back text whatever.\nOther key features are ordered lists and unordered lists:\n- unordered first entry\n- unordered second entry\n     - subelement of second entry\nWhile basic markdown has a limited set of rules, there are many more formatting and content options for documents produced in (R)-Markdown, far too many to detail here. These may combine markdown code, html code, latex code, and more. The following cheatsheets are very useful for writing (R)-markdown documents:\nMarkdown documents allow for an easy way to write reports. Content from multiple sources can easily be embedded into these documents allowing users to easily display objects such as plots or tables of data.4\nThere are various text formatting options in Markdown, far too many to detail here… The following cheatsheets are very useful for writing markdown documents:\n\nMarkdown cheatsheet\nR Markdown cheatsheet\n\n\n\nSee also (most useful, but highly detailed):\n\nR markdown - the definitive guide\n\nCode chunks provide an easy way to embed code into your R Markdown files. The code language is not just limited to R either, as other languages can be used. This means that there is a wide variety of content which can be displayed in a chunk. Such as tables of data:\n\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nCode chunks are defined by wrapping text inside ```  ```. The above example was coded using:\n```{r}\nhead(iris)\n\nOptions can be specified inside of the curly brackets {} More information is provided here\n\n\nA.6.3 Inline code\nInline code is a quick and easy way to put snippets of R code. As an alternative to using code chunks, R code can simply be placed inside of `r `. For example, this can be used as an easy way to insert the value of a variable into a paragraph without inserting a chunk.\n\n\nA.6.4 Latex/maths\nR Markdown also can make use of the LaTeX document preparation system, which is popular for writing technical documents with mathematical content. This allows us to publish documents which include equations such as:\n\\[y = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1 +\\beta_2x_2+...+\\beta_kx_k+u\\]\nWhich is written using $$y = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1 +\\beta_2x_2+...+\\beta_kx_k+u.$$. Using $$ means that the equation will be centered on the page. Alternatively $ can be used in the same way, without the centering.\nA very useful guide to maths in R Markdown provides a detailed outline of the various mathematical symbols which can be used.\n\n\nA.6.5 Custom styles\nBookdown allows for users to build their own custom styles in order to change the appearance of documents. To create styles for HTML projects a custom css file is used. For these projects, styles are contained in support/tufte_plus.css. To use a defined style, the user can specify options at the start of a chunk, or using a HTML wrapper as show below for margin notes.\n\nMore on creating styles here. Below will outline several key styles used throughout these projects:\n‘Notes’\n\n\n` can be specified at the start of the block, or a HTML wrapper can be used. This assigns the .note formatting from the tufte_plus.css file to the chunk.\n\n\nMargin notes Margin notes are used throughout these projects as a way of displaying information in an organised and aesthetically pleasing way. To add a margin note, text is placed inside the following HTML wrapper:5\n\n{html}^[Your margin note goes here. ]\nOr margin notes can be added by using chunk options.\n\nFolding boxes\n\n\n` at the start of a chunk, or using a HTML wrapper.\n\n\n\nA.6.6 Adding references/citations\nAs with any academic work, it is always important to reference sourced material. Across these projects the following software is used:\n\nSetup\n\nPandoc provides a way to generate formatted references as well as a bibliography in R-Markdown.\nThe bibliography file to be sourced is specified within ‘YAML’ content, which guides the processing of these documents. (YAML content is generally enclosed with a three-dash --- break at top and bottom.)\nI generally specify the bibliography source in the YAML at the top of the .Rmd file, or for Bookdown projects in the the YAML content in index.Rmd.\n\n\nBibTeX\n\nThe BibTeX format refers to a stylized file format which is used predomoninantly for lists of references, mainly and originally for working with latex.. BibTeX bibliographies use the .bib extension. For example the bibliography for this project is references.bib. For more information on BibTeX see here\n\nZotero\n\nZotero is a free open source reference manager, which enables users to sync their library of references across multiple devices. Similarly to other reference managers, Zotero offers plugins for popular browsers such as Chrome and Safari. This project makes use of a shared reference library in Zotero, contact daaronr AT gmail.com to be added. Download Zotero\n\nBetter BibTeX for Zotero\n\nBetter BibTeX for Zotero is a add-on for Zotero. Among other things it allows the Zotero library to be exported from Zotero for use in Markdown. Installation instructions are provided here.\n\nCitr package (addin) for RStudio\n\n\n*Note 1 Jun 2021:** The discussion of Citr is now mainl outdated, as there is now citation support within Rstudio, at least in the visual mode. I have removed this from the content (14 Jun 2021)\n\n\n\nA.6.7 Specific system for adding references in this project\nMethod 1 (recommended): Rstudio visual markdown editor\n\nInstall Zotero software, Rstudio, and citr package (an ‘Add-in’). Make sure all are running.\nJoin the Zotero reinstein_research_and_impact_collabs group\nMake sure the group library is syncronised with your Zotero\nTry to add the citation/reference using the visual markdown editor in Rstudio (see here)\n\n\nNote that [(at symbol) reference] gives a different format than (at symbol) reference (see below test).\nIf the reference is not present, add it to the Zotero library (there are various methods, from Google Scholar etc) and synchronise your library, and try it again.\nIf you are not sure what the reference is, consult the Airtable, use context, and consult other survey papers. If you are still not sure ask on Github.\n\nMethod 2: Dropbox-syncronised Zotero to bibtex\n(I’ll explain this later)\n\n\nAdding a shortcut key for ‘insert citations’ in R-Studio\nYou may be able to save time in adding citations (via the CitR add-in in R-Studio) if you use a shortcut key.\nSelect (menu bar):\n\nTools\nAddins\nBrowse addins\n\nClick in box “keyboard shortcuts”\nClick the addin “Insert Citations” under ‘shortcuts’, and enter a keyboard shortcut of your choice.\n\n\nA.6.8 A test of adding references\nTest a reference from reinstein_bibtex.bib: Fong and Oberholzer-Gee (2010) no brackets (Fong and Oberholzer-Gee 2010) with brackets"

    "text": "A.7 How to ‘build’ and view the book\nOne way is within RStudio\n\nBe sure Github repo is synced so all files are present\nPackages need to be installed, but this should (?) be done automatically when you build via the source(here(\"code\", \"baseoptions.R\")) line in index.Rmd\n\nknitr is a key package\n\n\n\n17 Nov 2021 update: I’m re-working this to use the ‘renv’ tool for organizing packages\n\n\nClick ‘Build’, ‘Build all’, or the shortcut key shift-cmd-b\n\n… this seems to run the command rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')\n\n\nBuilding may take some time, depending on how much code is present in the Rmd files and what that code does\n\n17 Nov 2021: I’m changing this so that this will be done through executing the root directory file main.R.\nThis should be better structured and more consistent with how I do this in my other bookdowns. s\n\n\nIt puts all the Rmd files specified in the _bookdown.yml into a single file, here labeled barriers-to-effective-giving.knit.md (I think), and then turns that into html, also invoking bibtex along the way\nDepending on your RStudio settings (-Tools, -Project Options, -Build tools, -Preview book after building), it may put up a ‘preview version’ of the site. Sometimes an error will appear such as “some/file not found”, this can typically be bypassed by clicking open in browser.\nAll the ‘new’ output is directed to be put in the ‘docs’ folder, a bunch of html files. You can view those ‘local’ files in any web browser\nOnce you commit and push, the ‘new’ bookdown website should be up on the WWW\n\n\nA.7.1 Exporting Rmarkdown to Google Docs/Drive\nNote: the trackdown package also seems to be a particular useful extension to this.\nSuppose that we wish to share our work with collaborators who aren’t familiar with Github or Rmarkdown. In this case we may find it useful to export work to Google Drive. This process is easy in R as we can use the googledrive package and markdrive packages. Below we will outline a basic workflow for rendering Rmarkdown and uploading these files to Google Drive. During this process files are rendered and converted to Google Docs.\n\nlibrary(markdrive)\n\n# Render and upload Rmarkdown file\ngdoc_render(filename=\"sections/barriers_old_classification.Rmd\",\n            gdoc_name= \"A test\",\n            gdoc_path= \"Test folder\")\n\nIn the above example we render an Rmarkdown document to HTML and upload the corresponding document to Google Drive. This process tends to work best with Rmd files with html_document output.\nOne drawback of this method is that rendering and uploading files multiple times will result in multiple files. That is, duplicate files are not identified and removed automatically. This is possible when uploading files to Google Drive using the googledrive package, however, due to the need to render and convert our Rmarkdown file we must make use of the markdrive commands which do not support this. We now consider a workflow which identifies existing files and moves these to trash. This ensures that we do not create duplicates when uploading.\nWarning: Make sure that you do not already have files with duplicate labels inside your gdoc_path. Otherwise these files will be deleted.\n\nlibrary(googledrive)\nlibrary(markdrive)\n\n# Define files and folders for simplicity\ngdoc_file <- \"A test\"\ngdoc_path <- \"Term 2\"\nlocal_file <- \"test.Rmd\"\n\n# Check if our file to upload exists already\n# If so move this file to trash\nif (gdoc_file %in% drive_ls(path=gdoc_path)$name) {\n  drive_trash(as_dribble(paste(gdoc_path, gdoc_file, sep=\"/\")))\n}\n\n# Render and upload Rmarkdown file\ngdoc_render(filename= local_file,\n            gdoc_name= gdoc_file,\n            gdoc_path= gdoc_path)"

You should receive this invitations via email and it should also be in your “notifications” on Github.\n\n\nA.8.1 Creating a Branch and a ‘pull request’\n\n\nA.8.2 GitHub web page content\nAs noted, GitHub is a web page and interface that acts as an external server and storage space for git projects/repos. It works well with this and also incorporate several additional features. You can see it and even interact with much of a repo simply via the GitHub webpage without even installing Git (but I strongly recommend that you do install Git as well as a tool like GitHub Desktop, unless you want to solely rely on command line Git).\n\nWeb page for a repo\n knitr::include_graphics(‘../picsfigs/ea_barriers_github_repo_startpage.png’)\nIn your account when you click on the repo you’ll see something like the screen above. There are many tabs, starting with the code tab. At the top of this, you will see the list of folders and files, with messages describing the latest comments.6\nNote here we also see:\n\n48 ‘commits’\n2 ‘branches’\n2 contributors\n\nBelow this, some options allowing you to switch branch, manually upload files, clone or download etc.\n\n\nReadme for a repo\nBelow the list of files you should see the “readme” for this repository. This is a file ‘README.md’ stored in the root directory of this repository. If you click on it or look at the file you’ll see it is written in markdown syntax but the GitHub website renders it into a nice format.\nI typically use this readme to explain what the project is about and describe (and link) the folder structure.\n\n\nComments/notifications\nIn a variety of places within a repo when you are adding comments or content you can refer to a collaborator who will then receive a “notification” linking this content. (These are also called “callouts” in some systems.) These may come as as emails to that collaborator if they set a setting to get email notifications, but they will definitely appear as a notification, again that bell thing in the upper right hand corner.\n\n\nSeeing recent commits, history and ‘blame’\n\n\n\nShowing the most recent commits\n\n\n\n\nAbove, this shows the most recent commits.\nClicking on one of these commits will show you ‘what changed’ and old versus new versions.\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the most recent commits\n\n\nFor example, above we see something like a “split diff” view, with the ‘old version’ (before this commit) on the left and the ‘new version’ on the right. What is new is in green (with a ‘+’), and what is removed is in red highlight (with a “-”).\nHere we see that …\n\nin the file ‘sections/inertia.rmd’ a space has been added after ‘crowding out?’7\nin ‘present_puzzle.Rmd’ an (obsolete) ‘underline’ notation has been replaced with a third level markdown header (three # marks)\n\n\n\nCommenting within commits, etc., tagging collaborators in this\nOne way to ask questions, comment on changes and let people know about changes you made, is via adding a comment within a commit itself. (Check: can this be tied to an ‘issue’?)\n\n\n\nCommenting on a part of a commit, notifying a collaborator\n\n\nAbove, we see that by clicking on a plus sign that appears just to the right of the the line number when viewing a commit, we can add a comment on that particular part of the commit. We can then flag another collaborator (see ‘@daaronr’ above … when you type the ‘@’ you get a dropdown of collaborators) who will be notified of this.\nThis mode of commenting and conversation has the advantage of avoiding cluttering up the actual code and text with excess comments.\n\n\nYou can also link each comment to an ‘issue’ (issues are discussed below) by adding a hash to the comment and citing the issue number. This comment and link to the place in the code or text for that commit will then show up when you look at that issue. This makes the discussion more organized, at least we hope.\n\n\n\nLink an issue in a comment\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘Project’ board and ‘Issues’\n\nI discuss these features in a video guide here starting at about 11:46.\n[2022 video presenting this to Annabell Rayner HERE)[https://www.dropbox.com/s/fdp2vycyanumgqa/github_project_boards_and_issues.mp4?dl=0]\nNote that the ‘project board’ and ‘issues’ are just tools on the Github web site for discussing and managing the project; these are not files or data, it’s a built-in tool.\n\n\nthe Project is a ‘Kanban board’ for managing tasks, responsibilities and progress\nthese should be entered as ‘issues’, enabling assignments and further discussion within the ‘issues’ pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\na github ‘Project’\n\n\n\n\n\nKanban for the github ‘Project’\n\n\n\n\n\nOne task/issue in the Kanban\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing this issue and its discussion"

We focus specifically on evidence in the charitable domain, but we also consider the broader evidence for these biases in other contexts.\n8\nFor each barrier or bias, we consider why it is may be particularly relevant to effective giving.\n\n\n\nbarriers to EAG, why relevant\n\n\n\n\nWe further propose and discuss tools addressing these barriers and promoting effective charitable giving.\n\n\n\ntools remedies"

    "text": "Some of the social norms around charitable giving could work against the ideas of effective altruism. Cialdini and Trost (1998) define social norms as follows:\n\nSocial norms are rules and standards that are understood by members of a group, and that guide and/or constrain social behavior without the force of laws. These norms may emerge out of interaction with others; they may or may not be stated explicitly, and any sanctions for deviating from them come from social networks, not from the legal system\n\nElster (1989) explains how the use of social norms could pose a problem for how rational individuals are, and how as a result social norms could contribute to inefficiencies:\n\nOne of the most persistent cleavages in the social sciences is the opposition between two lines of thought conveniently associated with Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, between homo economicus and homo sociologicus. Of these, the former is supposed to be guided by instrumental rationality, while the behavior of the latter is dictated by social norms… The former adapts to changing circumstances, always on the lookout for improvements. The latter is insensitive to circumstances, sticking to the prescribed behavior even if new and apparently better options become available\n\nIf social norms can cause departures from efficiency, then this could be considered as one of the causes of ‘ineffective’ altruism. It should be noted that this comparison between homo economicus and homo sociologicus is similar to a distinction offered by Thaler and Sunstein (2008). They similarly argued that we should understand human behaviour by viewing people as ‘homo sapiens’ rather than ‘homo economicus’, as ‘Humans’ rather than ‘Econs’ (Thaler and Sunstein 2008). While discussion from Thaler and Sunstein (2008), Tversky and Kahneman (1973) and the others in Behavioural Economics has focused more on how the use of heuristics can cause departures from rationality, as we discussed here, this section looks at the impact of social norms on the efficiency of giving.1\n\n\nAsks (Own category?)\nDonation requests increase the propensity to give (Yörük 2009). There is a conventional wisdom that “most donations occur in response to an ask”. If there are systematic asks for non-EA causes this may crowd out EG.\n\n\nEvidence from Berman et al. (2018)\nThe idea that ‘charity is a subjective decision’ may constitute a social norm, a systemic factor inhibiting effective giving. We discuss this in more detail under evaluation aversion, particularly in subsection @ref(subjectivity)."

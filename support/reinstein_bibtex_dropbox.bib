  abstract = {Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.},

  abstract = {FutureMAP, a project of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, was to involve experiments to determine whether information markets could improve Defense Department decisionmaking. Information markets are securities markets used to derive information from the prices of securities whose liquidation values are contingent on future events. The government intended to use such a market to assess the probabilities of potential political assassinations, and the indelicacy of this potential application contributed to a controversy leading to the cancellation of the program. In this Article, Professor Abramowicz assesses whether information markets in theory could be useful to administrative agencies, and it concludes that information markets could help discipline administrative agency predictions, but only if a number of technical hurdles such as the danger of manipulation can be overcome. Because the predictions of well-functioning information markets are objective, they function as a tool that exhibits many of the same virtues in predictive tasks that cost- benefit analysis offers for normative policy evaluation. Both approaches can help to overcome cognitive errors, thwart interest group manipulation, and discipline administrative agency decisionmaking. The Article suggests that the two forms of analysis might be combined to produce a ``predictive cost-benefit analysis.'' In such an analysis, an information market would predict the outcome of a retrospective cost- benefit analysis, to be conducted some years after the decision whether to enact a particular policy. As long as the identity of the eventual decisionmaker cannot be anticipated, predictive cost-benefit analysis estimates how an average decisionmaker would be expected to evaluate the policy. Because the predictive cost-benefit analysis assessment is not dependent on the identity of current agency officials, they cannot shade the numbers to justify policies that the officials prefer for idiosyncratic or ideological reasons.}

During the democratic period, when the Weimar government introduced progovernment political news, the growth of Nazi popularity slowed down in areas with access to radio. This effect was reversed during the campaign for the last competitive election as a result of the pro-Nazi radio broadcast following Hitler's appointment as chancellor. During the consolidation of dictatorship, radio propaganda helped the Nazis enroll new party members. After the Nazis established their rule, radio propaganda incited anti-Semitic acts and denunciations of Jews to authorities by ordinary citizens. The effect of anti-Semitic propaganda varied depending on the listeners' predispositions toward the message. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect in places with historically low anti-Semitism.}

The paper adapts these models to gender discrimination in the workplace, the economics of poverty and social exclusion, and the household division of labor.

In Study 1, an experiment using real charitable appeals, giving more money to charity led to higher levels of happiness only when participants gave to causes that explained how these funds are used to make a difference in the life of a recipient. In Study 2, participants were asked to reflect upon a time they spent money on themselves or on others in a way that either had a positive impact or had no impact. Participants who recalled a time they spent on others that had a positive impact were happiest.

  abstract = {Most donors make contributions to public goods without doing any research. Organizations that aim to increase cooperation can encourage more informed giving by providing more and detailed information to society. However, information provision is costly and organizations have limited resources. Thus, it is important for these organizations to consider the benefits of such provision. This paper investigates the capacity of information to increase public good contributions. We theoretically and experimentally examine the impact of information provision on voluntary contributions to a linear public good with an uncertain marginal per-capita return (MPCR). Uninformed subjects make contribution decisions based only on the expected MPCR (i.e. the prior distribution), while informed subjects observe the realized MPCR before contributing. Using a theoretical model of other-regarding preferences, we find that the impact of information on average contributions crucially depends on the generosity level of the population, modeled as a stochastic increase in the pro-social preferences. In particular, a less generous population substantially increases contributions in response to good news of higher than expected MPCR and reduces contributions relatively little in response to bad news of lower than expected MPCR. The opposite is true for a more generous population. Thus, the overall impact of information is to increase (reduce) average contributions when the population is less (more) generous. We find strong support for these theoretical predictions using a two-stage lab experiment. First, we measure subjects' levels of generosity in the public good game using an online experiment. Then using the data collected in the online experiment, we control for the level of generosity in the lab. Our findings are in line with the theoretical predictions, and suggest that a more targeted information provision may be a successful strategy to improve contributions to public goods.

  abstract = {This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates the impact of information provision on voluntary contributions to a linear public good with an uncertain marginal per-capita return (MPCR). Uninformed donors make contribution decisions based only on the expected MPCR (i.e. the prior distribution), while informed donors observe the realized MPCR before contributing. The theoretical analysis predicts that the impact of information on average contributions crucially depends on the generosity level of the population, modeled as a stochastic change in the pro-social preferences. In particular, a less generous population increases contributions substantially in response to good news of higher than expected MPCR and reduces contributions relatively little in response to bad news of lower than expected MPCR. The opposite is true for a more generous population. Thus, the theory predicts that information provision increases (reduces) average contributions when the population is less (more) generous. This prediction finds strong support in a two-stage lab experiment. The first stage measures subjects' generosity in the public good game using an online experiment. The resulting measure is used to create more and less generous groups in the public good lab experiment, which varies the information provided to these groups in the lab. The findings are in line with the theoretical predictions, suggesting that targeted information provision to less generous groups may be more beneficial for public good contributions than uniform information provision.},

Our results indicate that the question `which is the fair sex?' has a complicated answer\"A\^iwhen altruism is expensive, women are kinder, but when it is cheap, men are more altruistic. That is, we \'efind that the male and female `demand curves for altruism' cross, and that men are more responsive to price changes. Furthermore, men are more likely to be either perfectly selfish or perfectly seleflss, whereas women tend to be `equalitarians' who prefer to share even ... Second, this indicates a need for more attention to sex differences in experimental economics. If differ- ences appear with respect to altruism, they may appear in other behavior as well.23 This, in turn, means that researchers would be wise to assure that their experimental \'endings are the result of economic incentives and not of varying sex compositions of their control and treatment groups. There are also potential applications of this result to the real world. If sex differences in altruism are truly present, as sug- gested by evidence from charitable giving and from restaurant tipping, then those who broker in altruism, such as charities and fundraisers, may \'end it in their interests to learn more about these differences and to exploit them in their enterprises. For tax policy, sex difference in altruism may also indicate that the inci- dence of the tax deduction to charity may differ by sex as well, with men\"A\^iand the charities they favor\"A\^igetting a greater share of the subsidy.}

This paper explores the possibility that such "leadership giving" provides a signal to all other givers that the charity is of high quality. The dilemma is that if the lead giver can deceive others to believe the charity is of higher quality than it truly is, then these followers will make larger contributions, which will benefit the leader. Hence, the leader must give an unusually large amount to convey a credible signal of the quality. This sets up a war-of-attrition game for who will pay the cost to signal the quality. Since the wealthy have the lowest opportunity cost of providing the signal, they, in equilibrium, move first to provide the signal of quality with exceptionally large gifts.},

In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction between givers and receivers, which clearly must influence choices. Charities, for example, speak of the ``power of asking.'' Indeed, evolutionary theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We experimentally examine communication in which one subject allocates 10 between herself and a receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair could speak. We found that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased \textemdash{} asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices were significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy was heightened by putting allocators ``in the receiver's shoes,'' giving appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic behavior, and appears to largely work by heightening empathy.},

  abstract = {When the government gives a gr ant to a private charitable organization, do the donors to that organization give less? If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75\%. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30\% to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70\% to over 100\% of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Looking first at single-person households, we find men and women to have significantly different tastes for giving, setting up a potential conflict for married couples. We find that, with respect to total giving, married households tend to resolve these conflicts largely in favor of the husband's preferences. Bargaining over charitable giving, rather than letting one spouse take charge, is estimated to reduce giving by at least 6 percent. When the woman is the decisionmaker, she will still make a significantly different allocation of those charity dollars, preferring to give to more charities but to give less to each. Our results give new insights into both the demographics of charitable giving and the costliness of household bargaining.},

This result is taken as evidence for alternative models that assume people experience some private benefit from contributing to public goods.},

  abstract = {Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency. We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior. 6. Conclusion This paper set out to understand whether removing confidentiality affects giving in a series of public goods experiments. We systematically alter the identification of subjects and information on their contributions. By unmasking subjects, we allow for various social effects, like pride, shame, social comparison and prestige, to work. If identity and information matter, this raises the natural question: have fund-raising institutions been tailored to take advantage of these effects? To get a glimpse into fund-raising strategies, we also conducted two additional treatments. The first allows subjects the option of giving anonymously. The second reports contributions in categories. This allows us to observe whether these particular fund-raising practices may have special merit, and if they may be worth studying in more detail. We found, first, that identity and information can matter. Knowing only the distribution of contributions, but not the identity of the givers, has no discernible effect. Knowing only the identity but not the individual contributions has a modest effect of increasing donations. However, knowing both who is in your group and what each is choosing can significantly increase giving. Identification tends to decrease free riding, and the combination of information and identification tends to increase contributions. Looking more deeply, we discovered that some people consistently set a `good example' by contributing large amounts in the first period. We found that the announcement structure has an important effect on the number of these leaders and their ability to lead. Surprisingly, leaders emerge most strongly when they can voluntarily report their contribution to the rest of the group. Moreover, as social comparison suggests, their role in the group is important as they appear to increase the contribution levels of others. Along with the leaders, we also uncovered laggards who consistently give small amounts in the first period. Laggards, we found, are cowardly. They emerge when information on actions and actors is noisy, and they cannot be easily identified. Even more insidious is that their presence appears to decrease the contributions of others. It seems the best way to deal with laggards is to make their actions and identities known. Second, and perhaps surprisingly, we found that two popular fund-raising practices had significant impacts on behavior. For the option to remain anonymous we found that, while few chose to do so, having the option to contribute anonymously increased contributions to their highest level and produced the most leaders. That is, giving people the option to report their contributions results in more giving than required reporting. It would appear that something about empowering people with the choice to announce their contributions\textemdash even though it is a `false' choice that no one would reject\textemdash might actually focus them more on being leaders and example setters. This suggests that indeed charities may be taking advantage of subtle behavioral effects in designing this feature of the giving institution. Categories also have the potential to affect contributions by significantly shifting the distribution of contributions. This confirms [Harbaugh, 1998b] research, which incorporates a prestige motive to giving. People tend to contribute at the lower end of the contribution category, and some people give more to be in the higher category. Our results suggest that carefully constructing the reporting categories has the potential to significantly increase contributions. The research we presented here suggests a broad set of new questions for economic researchers, both theorists and experimenters. The effects that economists factor out of their experiments and, to a large extent, out of theoretical models may be the very effects that fund-raising institutions may be using to help overcome free riding and promote efficiency. This suggests that there may be much to be gained by shifting our research toward understanding individual preferences, social effects, and the institutions designed to take advantage of them. Indeed, this research could be seen as a first step at collecting the kind of information that may be useful to inform a theoretical model of fund-raising practices. s},

For known conditional publication probabilities, we propose median-unbiased estimators and associated confidence sets that correct for selective publication.

  abstract = {Colombia's PACES program provided over 125,000 pupils from poor neighborhoods with vouchers that covered approximately half the cost of private secondary school. Since many vouchers were allocated by lottery, we use differences in outcomes between lottery winners and losers to assess program effects. Three years into the program, lottery winners were 15 percentage points more likely to have attended private school, had completed .1 more years of schooling, and were about 10 percentage points more likely to have finished 8 th grade, primarily because they were less likely to repeat grades. The program did not significantly affect dropout rates. Lottery winners scored .2 standard deviations higher on standardized tests. There is some evidence that winners worked less than losers and were less likely to marry or cohabit as teenagers. On average, lottery winners increased their educational expenditure by about 70\% of the value of the voucher. Since winners also worked less, they devoted more total resources to education. Compared to an equivalent expansion of the public education system, the voucher program increased annual government educational expenditure by about 24 per winner. But the costs to the government and to participants were probably much less than the increase in winners' earnings due to greater educational attainment.},

The resulting VAM estimates are biased if the available control variables fail to capture all cross-school differences in student ability. This paper introduces a new test for VAM bias that asks whether VAM estimates accurately predict the achievement consequences of random assignment to specific schools. Test results from admissions lotteries in Boston suggest conventional VAM estimates may be misleading. This finding motivates the development of a hierarchical model describing the joint distribution of school value-added, VAM bias, and lottery compliance. We use this model to assess the substantive importance of bias in conventional VAM estimates and to construct hybrid value-added estimates that optimally combine ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimates of VAM parameters. Simulations calibrated to the Boston data show that, bias notwithstanding, policy decisions based on conventional VAMs are likely to generate substantial achievement gains. Estimates incorporating lotteries are less biased, however, and yield further gains.},

Simulating how black educational choices would change were they to face the white admission and aid rules shows that race-based advantages had little effect on earnings.

In particular, removing advantages in admissions substantially decreases the number of black students at top-tier schools, while removing advantages in financial aid causes a decrease in the number of blacks who attend college},

Moreover, we show that extrinsic incentives interact with image motivation and are therefore less effective in public than in private. Together, these results imply that image motivation is crowded out by monetary incentives; this means that monetary incentives are more likely to be counterproductive for public prosocial activities than for private ones.

This paper explores consumers' revealed purchasing behavior with regard to fair trade coffee and is apparently the first to do so in an actual market setting. In a series of experiments, we investigated differences in consumer responsiveness to relative price changes in fair trade and non-fair trade brewed coffees. In order to minimize the hypothetical bias that may be present in some experimental settings, we conducted our experiments in cooperation with a vendor who allowed us to vary prices in an actual coffee shop. Using a choice model, we found that purchasers of fair trade coffee were much less price responsive than those of other coffee products. The demonstration of low sensitivity to price suggests that the market premiums identified by stated preference studies do indeed exist and are not merely artifacts of hypothetical settings.}

  abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean-variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.}

These include supervised learning methods for regression and classification, unsupervised learning methods, as well as matrix completion methods. Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics, methods that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, problems that include causal inference for average treat- ment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models.}

Empirical analysis is complicated by the expected correlation between institutional quality and student wealth, and the possible endogeneity between institutional expenditures on education (one common measure of quality) and the level of alumni support the institution receives. This paper uses a two-stage least squares approach with data on quality and variables correlated with student wealth to address these issues. Quality variables are found to have a positive impact on the average alumni gift, with that impact most significant for private universities and liberal arts colleges. Wealth variables also have a positive impact on the average gift, with the estimated coefficients most significant for public universities. Development effort is very important in determining the level of giving for all three types of institutions.},

When it comes to foreign aid and international redistribution across racial lines, I argue that prejudice manifests not in an uncharitable, resentful way but in a paternalistic way because intergroup contact is minimal and because of how the media portray black foreigners. Using two survey experiments, I show that white Americans are more favorable toward aid when cued to think of foreign poor of African descent than when cued to think of those of East European descent. This relationship is due not to the greater perceived need of black foreigners but to an underlying racial paternalism that sees them as lacking in human agency. The findings confirm accusations of aid skeptics and hold implications for understanding the roots of paternalistic practices in the foreign aid regime.},

We find that the productivity of the average worker is at least 50 percent higher under piece rates than under relative incentives. We show that this is due to workers partially internalizing the negative externality their effort imposes on others under relative incentives, especially when working alongside their friends. Under piece rates, the relationship among workers does not affect productivity. Further analysis reveals that workers internalize the externality only when they can monitor others and be monitored. This rules out pure altruism as the underlying motive of workers' behavior. \textcopyright{} 2005 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}

To evaluate whether the existence of social connections is beneficial to the firm's overall performance, we explore how the effects of social connections vary with the strength of managerial incentives and worker's ability. To do so, we combine panel data on individual worker's productivity from personnel records with a natural field experiment in which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial incentives, from fixed wages to bonuses based on the average productivity of the workers managed. We find that when managers are paid fixed wages, they favor workers to whom they are socially connected irrespective of the worker's ability, but when they are paid performance bonuses, they target their effort toward high ability workers irrespective of whether they are socially connected to them or not. Although social connections increase the performance of connected workers, we find that favoring connected workers is detrimental for the firm's overall performance.},

In a second experiment, willingness to pay (from a hypothetical government windfall) for risk reduction was unaffected by whether the risk was described in terms of percentage or number of lives saved, even though subjects knew that the risks in question differed in prevalence. These results are consistent with the findings of Fetherstonhaugh et al., Jenni and Loewenstein, and others. I suggest that these results can be explained in terms of a general tendency to confuse proportions and differences, a confusion that is analogous to other confusions of quantitative dimensions in children, adults, the news media, and perhaps even the epidemiological literature.},

Each donor type was randomly assigned to treatments varying in two dimensions: (i) whether information was conveyed about the existence of an anonymous lead donor, and (ii) how individual donations would be matched by the anonymous lead donor. We find that aristocrats are significantly more likely to respond and that corporates give significantly more than individuals. Treatment effects moreover suggest that (proportional) matching is to be avoided for corporate donors.}

Investment preferences of survey respondents, estimated using the scale-adjusted version of a latent class choice model, also change during the crisis. We identify age and income as important determinants of preference classes in both surveys and age is also identified as a key determinant of variability (scale). Young and low income individuals make choices that are more consistent with standard mean-variance analysis, but older and higher income individuals react positively to both higher returns and increasing risk in returns. Overall we find a mild moderating of retirement investor risk tolerance in 2008.},

In a continuous time model in which the location of the zero profit social responsible entrant is fixed and the profit maximizing producer (PMP) limits himself to price competition without ethical imitation, we show that the optimal dynamic PMP's price is always lower than his optimal static price since the PMP producer knows that, by leaving too much market share to the other producer, he will reinforce the habit of socially responsible consumption and loose further market share in the future. We inspect the properties of equilibria when the PMP can ethically imitate the entrant and when the entrant is free to choose his location. We find that, in the first case, the threshold triggering a PMP strategy of ethical imitation and minimum price differentiation is lower in the dynamic than in the static case, depending on the PMP's shadow cost of changes in consumers social responsibility.},

The purposes of this article are (1) to understand the factors that have led Fair Trade to become a mixed-form market and (2) to propose some trails to understand the market dynamics that result from the interactions between the different types of players. We start by defining briefly Fair Trade, its different dimensions (including the ``fair'' quality of the products) and its organizational landscape, focusing on the distinction between the pioneer ``Alternative Trading Organizations'' and the second-mover companies. Then, we recall the theoretical emergence factors for each type of organization (nonprofit, co-operative and for- profit) and apply these emergence factors to the context of Fair Trade. This analysis allows us to capture the specificities of each type of operator with regard to Fair Trade and, thus, to have a better understanding of the competition dynamics in the sector. The latter analysis includes elements on ethical imitation, consumers' behaviors, effects on welfare and the role of the government, in order to outline some of the major trends in this rapidly evolving secto},

We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide-range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets.},

We argue in this paper that one of the driving forces behind this heterogeneity is the strength of local social ties. We use data from the BHPS on the location of the three closest friends and the frequency of contacts. We estimate the processes of friendship formation and residential mobility jointly, allowing for correlation between the two processes. Our results show that the location of the closest friends matters substantially in the mobility decision, and matters more than the frequency of contacts.},

The relationship of race to contributions was also observed by using both black and white subjects. One hundred and twenty black and 120 white subjects were randomly assigned to one of 8 verbal appeals in a 2 (High vs. Low Dependency) \texttimes{} 2 (Internal vs. External Causal Locus of Need) \texttimes{} 2 (``it is your social responsibility'' vs. ``it will make you feel good'' Expressed Reason for Giving) factorial design. The solicitor controlled for order effects by varying the sequence of these three variables within each experimental group. Main effects were found for Rae, Causal Locus of Need, and Expressed Reason for Giving: Whites contributed more than blacks, the external locus of need condition produced more giving than the internal condition, and persons who heard the ``feel good'' reason donated more than those in the ``social responsibility'' condition. Additionally, a significant Causal Locus of Need \texttimes{} Expressed Reason for Giving interaction was found. The combination of external locus of need and ``feel good'' was considerably more productive of contributions than the other three combinations. Implications of these results for the helping behavior literature are discussed.},

However, it is still debated to what extent results from laboratory experiments can be applied to field settings. One highly important question with respect to the external validity of experiments is whether the same individuals act in experiments as they would in the field. This paper presents evidence on how individuals behave in donation experiments and how the same individuals behave in a naturally occurring decision situation on charitable giving. The results show that behavior in experiments is correlated with behavior in the field. The results are robust to variations in the experimental setting, and the correlation between experimental and field behavior is between 0.25 and 0.4. We discuss whether this correlation should be interpreted as strong or weak and what consequences the findings have for experimental economics.},

In line with this proposition, the effective-altruism movement seeks to provide individuals with information regarding the effectiveness of charities in hopes that they will contribute to organizations that maximize the social return of their donation. In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes. In contrast to making a personal donation decision, outcome metrics are used to a much greater extent when choosing financial investments and when allocating aid resources as an agent of an organization. Implications for effective altruism are discussed.},

However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee,\"A\`os work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers,\"A\`o need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private sector DC plans is that public sector primary DC plans are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private sector plans largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match. We conclude by applying lessons from savings behavior in private sector savings plans to the design of public sector plans.},

If the F-statistic is above some threshold, usually 10, the instrument is deemed to satisfy one of the three core IV assumptions and used to test for the treatment effect. However, in many cases, the inference on the treatment effect does not take into account the strength test done a priori. In this paper, we show that not accounting for this pretest can severely distort the distribution of the test statistic and propose a method to correct this distortion, producing valid inference. A key insight in our method is to frame the F-test as a randomized convex optimization problem and to leverage recent methods in selective inference. We prove that our method provides conditional and marginal Type I error control. We also extend our method to weak instrument settings. We conclude with a reanalysis of studies concerning the effect of education on earning where we show that not accounting for pre-testing can dramatically alter the original conclusion about education's effects.},

Our theory of the demand for sleep differs from standard models of time use by assuming that sleep affects wages by affecting labor market productivity. Estimates of a system of demand equations demonstrate that higher wage rates reduce sleep time among men but increase their waking nonmarket time by an equal amount. Among women the wage effect on sleep is negative but very small.},

  abstract = {The importance of pricing decisions for firms has fueled an extensive stream of research on price elasticities. In an influential meta-analytical study, Tellis (1988) summarized price elasticity research findings until 1986. However, empirical generalizations on price elasticity require modifications because of (1) changes in market characteristics (i.e., characteristics of brands, product categories, and economic conditions) and (2) changes in the research methodology used to assess price elasticities. Therefore, the authors present a meta-analysis of price elasticity with new empirical generalizations on its determinants. Across a set of 1851 price elasticities based on 81 studies, the average price elasticity is -2.62. A salient finding is that over the past four decades, sales elasticities have significantly increased in magnitude, whereas share and choice elasticities have remained fairly constant. The authors find that accommodating price endogeneity has a strong (magnitude-increasing) impact on price elasticities. A striking null result is that accounting for heterogeneity does not affect elasticities significantly. The authors also present an analysis that explains the difference between their findings and Tellis's findings, and they indicate which new price elasticity studies are most desirable.}

One clear form of stress to the mother comes from the death of a parent. We examine the effects of the death of the mother's parent during pregnancy on both the short-run and the long-run outcomes of the infant. Our primary specification involves using mother fixed effects,\"A\^icomparing the outcomes of two children with the same mother but where a parent of the mother died during one of the pregnancies,\"A\^iaugmented with a control for whether there is a death around the time of the pregnancy in order to isolate true causal effects of a bereavement during pregnancy. We find small negative effects on birth outcomes, and these effects are bigger for boys than for girls. The effects on birth outcomes seems to be driven by deaths due to cardiovascular causes suggesting that sudden deaths are more difficult to deal with. However, we find no evidence of adverse effects on adult outcomes. The results are robust to alternative specifications.}

We provide a framework for formally "declaring" the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other "diag-nosands." Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach. for their many contributions to the broader project. The methods proposed in this paper are implemented in an accompanying open-source software package, DeclareDesign (Blair et al. 2018).},

Inequality in longevity, also increased during the 19th century, but then was reversed in the second half of the 20th century, perhaps mitigating the failure of income inequality to improve in the last decades.},

We introduce five definitions of nonprofit surplus (the analogue of profit) and identify when researchers should use one in preference to the other. The distinctions are especially important when analyzing endowed organizations because surpluses affect the amount and rate of accumulation of endowment assets. Conversely, an endowment affects how managers and analysts should calculate surplus. Information on IRS 990 reports is incomplete, so we explain how to construct a pro forma endowment portfolio and endowment spending from available data for the purpose of calculating operating surplus of endowed organizations. We argue that researchers doing statistical analyses with large data bases should distinguish between endowed organizations and those without endowments because their financial behavior may differ. To lump them together is likely to distort statistical results. Finally, we discuss practical issues of data cleaning when using data from IRS 990 reports.},

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.},

This mechanism consists of three procedures based on final grades from school (Abiturbestenverfahren, Auswahlverfahren der Hochschulen) and on waiting time (Wartezeitverfahren). While these procedures differ in the criteria applied for admission they all make use of priority matching. In priority matching schemes, it is not a dominant strategy for students to submit their true preferences. Thus, strategic behaviour is expected. Using the full data set of applicants, we are able to detect some amount of strategic behaviour which can lead to inefficient matching. Alternative ways to organize the market are briefly discussed.},

Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite stock market reactions.

We examine how to move beyond LATE in situations where the instrument is discrete, as it often is in applied research. Discrete instruments do not give sufficient support to identify the full range of marginal treatment effects (MTE) in the usual local instrumental variable approach. We show how an alternative estimation approach allows identification of richer specifications of the MTE when the instrument is discrete. One result is that the alternative approach identifies a linear MTE model even with a single binary instrument. Although restrictive, the linear MTE model nests the standard IV estimator: The model gives the exact same estimate of LATE while at the same time providing a simple test for its external validity and a linear extrapolation. Another result is that the alternative approach allows identification of a general MTE model under the auxiliary assumption of additive separability between observed and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. We apply these identification results to empirically assess the interaction between the quantity and quality of children. Motivated by the seminal quantity-quality model of fertility, a large and growing body of empirical research has used binary instruments to estimate LATEs of family size on child outcomes. We show that the effects of family size are both more varied and more extensive than what the LATEs suggest. Our MTE estimates reveal that the family size effects vary in magnitude and even sign, and that families act as if they possess some knowledge of the idiosyncratic effects in the fertility decision.}

Although this revolution is based on a simple set of economic and technological drivers, the authors argue that its implications are far-reaching for managers, consumers and the economy as a whole. This article looks at what has been dubbed the "Long Tail" phenomenon, examining how customers derive value from an important characteristic of Internet markets: the ability of online merchants to help consumers locate, evaluate and purchase a far wider range of products than they can typically buy via the traditional brick-and-mortar channels. The article examines the Long Tail from both the supply side and the demand side and identifies several key drivers. On the supply side, the authors point out how e-tailers' expanded, centralized warehousing allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater to more varied tastes. On the demand side, tools such as search engines, recommender software and sampling tools are allowing customers to find products outside of their geographic area. The authors also look toward the future to discuss second order amplified effects of Long Tail, including the growth of markets serving smaller niches.},

We consider multiple types of human conflict, including both interpersonal conflict, such as assault and murder, and intergroup conflict, including riots and civil war. We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1{$\sigma$} increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4\% and intergroup conflict by 11.3\%. We conclude by highlighting research priorities, including a better understanding of the mechanisms linking climate to conflict, societies' ability to adapt to climatic changes, and the likely impacts of...},

  abstract = {We examine the effectiveness in field settings of seven healthy eating nudges, classified according to whether they influence 1) cognition, via ``descriptive nutritional labeling,'' ``evaluative nutritional labeling,'' or ``salience enhancements''; 2) affect, via ``hedonic or sensory cues'' or ``healthy eating prods''; or 3) behavior, via ``convenience enhancements'' or ``plate and portion size changes.'' Compared with existing univariate meta-analyses, our multivariate three-level meta-analysis of 277 effect sizes controlling for eating behavior, population, and study characteristics yields smaller effect sizes overall. These effect sizes increase as the focus of the intervention shifts from cognition (d=.08, equivalent to -45 kcal/day) to affect (d=.22, -121 kcal) to behavior (d=.35, -186 kcal). Interventions are more effective at reducing unhealthy eating than at increasing healthy eating or reducing total eating. Effect sizes are larger in the US than in other countries, in restaurants or cafeterias than in grocery stores, and in studies including a control group. Effect sizes are similar for food selection vs. consumption, for children vs. adults, and are independent of study duration. Compared to the typical study, one testing the best nudge scenario should expect a fourfold increase in effectiveness, with half due to switching from cognitive to behavioral nudges.}

To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. \textcopyright{} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

The authors conclude that equilibrium concepts which are more complicated than Nash (such as sequential) can describe individual behavior well enough that theories using such equilibrium concepts are plausible.}

In this context we design a mechanism that not only encourages testing but also slows the spread of the disease through voluntary transmission.

In an expanded analysis of the published literature, we examined six distinct views about this relation: the focus of attention, objective self-awareness, separate process, social outlook, mood maintenance, and concomitance hypotheses. For each of 61 positive affect conditions in which it was possible to generate an effect-size estimate corresponding to the relative degree of helpfulness exhibited by positive mood subjects (compared with neutral affect subjects), judges assessed the contextual levels of variables relevant to each of the six hypotheses by reading the Method section of each article. Higher-order partial correlation coefficients were then calculated to isolate the independent contribution of each of the theoretically relevant variables to the variation among the 61 effect sizes. The results support the focus of attention, separate process, social outlook, and mood maintenance hypotheses, and partially support the objective self-awareness and concomitance hypotheses.

We present treatments formulated to minimize the social preference reasons to give and, despite this, the allocations are identical to our replication of the standard double blind game, implying that altruism might be the wrong interpretation of giving. Instead, we hypothesize that giving might be driven by participants coming to the lab ready 'to play'. The fact that there are strong correlations between participant responses to an attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder questionnaire and both the rate and level of giving provides direct support for the hypothesis that lab participants impulsively give money away. However, we also show that having players earn their endowments attenuates the bias. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2010.},

Partnering with a charity that provides public goods locally, we conducted a field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to one of four raffle treatments to examine the effectiveness of alternative incentive schemes designed to encourage either participation or ``volume.'' Contrary to theory which anticipates that gains can be made mostly on volume, our results indicate that significant revenue gains are available on both margins. Indeed, the large opportunity cost of using the standard linear raffle (in which the price per chance to win is fixed) that we find suggests the importance of mechanism design when considering the voluntary provision of public goods.},

The results illustrate that graduates are drawn to prospering regions with ample job opportunities, supposedly in order to advance their careers. They choose their places of residence so as to balance their commuting distances and the distances to their previous places of study. Residential amenities have a comparatively small effect on graduates' locational choices, whereas they appear to value accessibility of the place of residence.},

This article examines whether or not consumers care about ethical behaviour, and investigates the effect of good and bad ethical conduct on consumer purchase behaviour. Through focus group discussions it becomes clear that although we are more sophisticated as consumers today, this does not necessarily translate into behaviour which favours ethical companies and punishes unethical firms. The article concludes by some thoughts on how marketers might encourage consumers to engage in positive purchase behaviour in favour of ethical marketing.},

  abstract = {Two main reasons why people donate to charity are that they have been asked and asked by someone they care about. One would therefore expect that charitable organizations could benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising if they were able to persuade donors to do so for them. However, little is known on the costs and benefits of asking donors to fundraise. We investigate this by implementing a field experiment embedded in an online giving organization's web page. In our experiment, donors who have completed an online transaction were randomly asked to share having donated by posting on their Facebook (FB) wall or by sending a private message to a friend on FB. To further explore the impact of incentives on the willingness to fundraise, donors were also assigned to one of three treatments in which the organization added either \$0, \$1 or \$5 in the donor's name in exchange for sharing the information. We have several findings: (1) Donors respond to incentives: larger add-on donations increase the willingness to post having made a donation. (2) Nuisance costs may be important: willingness to post is over two times higher among those already logged into FB. (3) The type of ask matters: willingness to post via one's wall or via a private message is different. (4) There are benefits to incentivizing peer-to-peer fundraising in increased new donations.},

  abstract = {We describe the ``evaluability bias'': the tendency to weight the importance of an attribute in proportion to its ease of evaluation. We propose that the evaluability bias influences decision making in the context of charitable giving: people tend to have a strong preference for charities with low overhead ratios (lower administrative expenses) but not for charities with high cost-effectiveness (greater number of saved lives per dollar), because the former attribute is easier to evaluate than the latter. In line with this hypothesis, we report the results of four studies showing that, when presented with a single charity, people are willing to donate more to a charity with low overhead ratio, regardless of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with two charities simultaneously\textemdash thereby enabling comparative evaluation\textemdash they base their donation behavior on cost-effectiveness (Study 1). This suggests that people primarily value cost-effectiveness but manifest the evaluability bias in cases where they find it difficult to evaluate. However, people seem also to value a low overhead ratio for its own sake (Study 2). The evaluability bias effect applies to charities of different domains (Study 3). We also show that overhead ratio is easier to evaluate when its presentation format is a ratio, suggesting an inherent reference point that allows meaningful interpretation (Study 4).},

Based on a large-scale experiment using a representative panel of the Dutch population, we test if these measures can explain two different types of behavior: (i) behavior in laboratory risky financial decisions, and (ii) behavior in naturally-occurring field behavior under risk (financial, health and employment decisions). We find that measures of risk attitude are related to behavior in laboratory financial decisions and the most complex measures are outperformed by simpler measures. However, measures of risk attitude are not related to risk-taking in the field, calling into question the methods currently used for the purpose of measuring actual risk preferences. We conclude that while the external validity of measures of risk attitude holds in closely related frameworks, this validity is compromised in more remote settings.},

Though it is customary to analyse price discrimination problems by the calculus of variations after postulating a continuum of types, we assume a finite number of types and exploit the geometry and duality of the contract set and the structure of the programming specification. We analyse in detail the qualitative properties of the model's solution and show by construction that our results exhaust the implications of the model for equilibrium contract pairs. We show that imperfect discrimination is not bounded in welfare terms between perfect discrimination and single-price monopoly and that the deadweight loss, consumer surplus and output comparisons between single-price monopoly and imperfect discrimination are ambiguous.},

  abstract = {We report results from a field experiment in which a randomized subset of newly hired workers at a large financial institution received a flyer containing information about the employer's 401(k) plan and the value of contributions compounding over a career. Younger workers who received the flyer were significantly more likely to begin contributing to the plan relative to their peers in the control group. Many workers do not participate in their employers' supplemental retirement savings programs, even though these programs offer substantial tax advantages and immediate returns due to matching contributions. From a survey of new hires we find that many workers choose not to contribute to the plan because they have other financial priorities. However, some non-participants lack the financial literacy to appreciate the benefit. These findings indicate that simple informational interventions can nudge workers to participate in retirement saving plans and enhance individual well-being and retirement income security}

  abstract = {Background Despite many decades of declining mortality rates in the Western world, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this research we evaluate the optimal mix of lifestyle, pharmaceutical and population-wide interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Methods and Findings In a discrete time Markov model we simulate the ischaemic heart disease and stroke outcomes and cost impacts of intervention over the lifetime of all Australian men and women, aged 35 to 84 years, who have never experienced a heart disease or stroke event. Best value for money is achieved by mandating moderate limits on salt in the manufacture of bread, margarine and cereal. A combination of diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor and low-cost statin, for everyone with at least 5\% five-year risk of cardiovascular disease, is also cost-effective, but lifestyle interventions aiming to change risky dietary and exercise behaviours are extremely poor value for money and have little population health benefit. Conclusions There is huge potential for improving efficiency in cardiovascular disease prevention in Australia. A tougher approach from Government to mandating limits on salt in processed foods and reducing excessive statin prices, and a shift away from lifestyle counselling to more efficient absolute risk-based prescription of preventive drugs, could cut health care costs while improving population health.},

We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

Participants are in six sequences of five rounds of a two-person public good game in partner design. At the end of each sequence, they can select a new partner out of six group members. Unidirectional and bidirectional partner selection mechanisms are introduced and compared to controls with random partner rematching. Results demonstrate significantly higher cooperation in correspondence to unidirectional partner selection than to bidirectional selection and random rematching. Average monetary effort for being able to choose a partner is substantially high and remains stable.}

From data generated by 290 subject pairs, we find that women are more sensitive than men to the costs of generous actions when deciding whether to be generous. The factors that affect the level of generosity observed in our experiments are reciprocal motivation, the level of money payoffs, and the level of social distance in the experimental protocol. The relatively greater sensitivity of women to the costs of generous behavior can explain most of the apparent inconsistencies in previously reported findings. (JEL C70, C91, D63, D64)},

  abstract = {Acknowledging the increasing attention in the literature devoted to the incorporation of ethical considerations into consumers'' purchase decisions, this paper explores the notion of an ethical product. It is argued that ethical issues have long been involved in consumers'' product evaluations, but that there has been little academic investigation of ethics in terms of product concepts and theories. Ethics are thus examined in the context of the augmented product concept, and two dimensions of ethical augmentation are identified: direction and content. These dimensions are set out and discussed at some length, and then they are used to construct an ethical product matrix. It is shown how this could be used to provide structure and coherence to examinations of the perceived ethics of any given product offering. The implications of the analysis offered in the paper are discussed, and a number of limitations of the ethical product notion are identified. Finally some conclusions and directions for future research are suggested.},

Farber's (2005, 2008) empirical analyses and Botond Ko.szegi and Matthew Rabin's (2006; henceforth "KR") theory of reference-dependent preferences. Following KR, our model has targets for hours as well as income, determined by proxied rational expectations. Our model, estimated with Farber's data, reconciles his finding that stopping probabilities are significantly related to hours but not income with Colin Camerer et al.'s (1997) negative "wage" elasticity of hours; and avoids Farber's criticism that estimates of drivers' income targets are too unstable to yield a useful model of labor supply.}

It presents general expressions for the optimal commodity tax rates and proves that contrary to Atkinson and Stiglitz's (1976) result, differential commodity taxation remains a useful instrument of tax policy even if preferences are separable between labor and produced goods. When cross substitution effects are zero, the expressions resemble traditional many households Ramsey rules. In a Cobb-Douglas illustration, where endowments differ only in good 1 (interpreted as `wealth'), the tax on good 2 provides an indirect way to tax the unobservable wealth.}

In recent decades, researchers have sought a comprehensive understanding of the psychology of moral expansiveness. We first review the history of conceptual and methodological approaches in understanding our moral boundaries, with a particular focus on the recently developed Moral Expansiveness Scale. We then explore individual differences in moral expansiveness, attributes of entities that predict their inclusion in moral circles, and cognitive and motivational factors that help explain what we include within our moral boundaries and why they may shrink or expand. Throughout, we highlight the consequences of these psychological effects for real-world ethical decision making.},

For their part, in the past two decades academics have begun to more actively partner with organizations to generate data via field experimentation. While this revolution in evidence- based approaches has served to deepen the economic science, recently a credibility crisis has caused even the most ardent experimental proponents to pause. This study takes a step back from the burgeoning experimental literature and introduces 12 actions that might help to alleviate this credibility crisis and raise experimental economics to an even higher level. In this way, we view our ``12 action wish list'' as discussion points to enrich the field. Eszter}

It will be analysed both thechoice made before enrolling at university and that one made after obtaining adegree. Data drawing from the last sample survey on employment conditions ofthe Italian students graduated in 2004 three years after obtaining their degree(2007), led by the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), will be used. Twoindices - one for research quality and the other one for teaching quality - willbe used as indicators of university quality, developed by using the results of thefirst government evaluation of Italian university research carried out by the InterministerialCommittee for Research Evaluation (2007). The results confirmthat the quality of university teaching and research significantly influence migrationmovements of Italian students. Furthermore, since most students tend to remainin the province where they carried out their university studies, after theirdegree, the results show that the basic choice for accumulating human capital\guillemotleft in loco\guillemotright{} - which could be the subject of appropriate policies - is that madewhen choosing the university. It is from this point of view that \guillemotleft university quality\guillemotright{} represents a potential instrument of \guillemotleft intervention\guillemotright{} in order to counterbalancethe negative effects of brain drain on the accumulation of human capital inthe regions where migration flows originate.},

This paper extends earlier work by Dale and Krueger (2002) that examined the relationship between the college that students attended in 1976 and the earnings they self-reported reported in 1995 on the C\&B follow-up survey. In this analysis, we use administrative earnings data to estimate the return to various measures of college selectivity for a more recent cohort of students: those who entered college in 1989. We also estimate the return to college selectivity for the 1976 cohort of students, but over a longer time horizon (from 1983 through 2007) using administrative data. We find that the return to college selectivity is sizeable for both cohorts in regression models that control for variables commonly observed by researchers, such as student high school GPA and SAT scores. However, when we adjust for unobserved student ability by controlling for the average SAT score of the colleges that students applied to, our estimates of the return to college selectivity fall substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero. There were notable exceptions for certain subgroups. For black and Hispanic students and for students who come from less-educated families (in terms of their parents' education), the estimates of the return to college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for unobserved student characteristics.}

The absence of mobility is a factor behind high unemployment when jobless people prefer to remain in their home region rather than to go prospecting in more dynamic areas. In this paper, we attempt to understand the determinants of mobility by introducing the concept of local social capital. Using data from a European household panel (ECHP), we provide various measures of social capital, which appears to be a strong factor of immobility. It is also a fairly large factor of unemployment when social capital is clearly local, while other types of social capital are found to have a positive effect on employability. We also find evidence of the reciprocal causality, that is, individuals born in another region have accumulated less local social capital. Finally, observing that individuals in the South of Europe appear to accumulate more local social capital, while in Northern Europe they tend to invest in more general types of social capital, we argue that part of the European unemployment puzzle can be better understood thanks to the concept of local social capital.},

In, this paper, I survey the empirical evidence from the field on these three classes of deviations. The evidence covers a number of applications, from consumption to finance, from crime to voting, from charitable giving to labor supply. In the class of nonstandard preferences, I discuss time preferences (self-control problems), risk preferences (reference dependence), and social preferences. On nonstandard beliefs, I present evidence on over-confidence, on the law of small numbers, and on projection bias. Regarding nonstandard decision, making, I cover framing, limited attention, menu effects, persuasion and social pressure, and emotions. I also present evidence on how rational actors-firms, employers, CEOs, investors, and politicians-respond to the nonstandard behavior described in, the survey. Finally, I briefly discuss under what conditions experience and,market interactions limit the impact of the nonstandard features.},

We conduct a large-scale real-effort experiment with eighteen treatment arms. We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives.We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually. As a further comparison, we present a metaanalysis of similar treatments in the literature. Overall, predictions based on the literature are correlated with, but underperform, the expert forecasts.}

  abstract = {Nudge interventions-behaviorally-motivated design changes with no financial incentives-have quickly expanded from academic studies to larger implementations in so-called Nudge Units in governments. This provides a unique opportunity to compare interventions in research studies, versus at scale. In this paper, we assemble a unique data set including all trials run by two of the largest Nudge Units in the United States, including 126 RCTs covering over 23 million individuals. We compare these trials to a separate sample of nudge trials published in academic journals from two recent meta-analyses. In papers published in academic journals, the average impact of a nudge is very large-an 8.7 percentage point take-up increase over the control. In the Nudge Unit trials, the average impact is still sizable and highly statistically significant, but smaller at 1.4 percentage points. We show that a large share of the gap is accounted for by publication bias, exacerbated by low statistical power, in the sample of published papers; in contrast, the Nudge Unit studies are well-powered, a hallmark of "at scale" interventions. Accounting for publication bias, and some differences in characteristics, reconciles the two estimates. We also compare these results to the predictions of academics and practitioners. Most forecasters overestimate the impact for the Nudge Unit interventions, though nudge practitioners are almost perfectly calibrated.},

  abstract = {How much do different monetary and non-monetary motivators induce costly effort? Does the effectiveness line up with the expectations of researchers and with results in the literature? We conduct a large-scale real-effort experiment with eighteen treatment arms. We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives.We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually. As a further comparison, we present a metaanalysis of similar treatments in the literature. Overall, predictions based on the literature are correlated with, but underperform, the expert forecasts.}

  abstract = {Recent theories endogenize the attitude endowments of individuals, assuming that they are shaped by the attitudes of parents and other role models. This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three aspects of the attitude transmission process highlighted in this theoretical literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents, which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes, willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling the socialization production function and for policies focused on affecting children's non-cognitive skills. The paper also provides evidence that the transmission of risk and trust attitudes affects a wide variety of child outcomes, implying a potentially large total effect on children's economic situation.}

Most of the debate, however, is focused on the prevalence of common methods variance and ignores common methods bias, or the divergence between observed and true relationships among constructs. This article assesses the level of common methods bias in all multitrait-multimethod correlation matrices published over a 12-year period in a set of six social science journals using a combination of structural equation modeling and meta-analysis. The results indicate that only 46\% of the variation in measures is attributable to the constructs, that 32\% of the observed variation in measures is attributable to common methods variance, and that common methods variance results in a 26\% bias in the observed relationships among constructs. This level of bias is cause for concern but does not invalidate many research findings.},

This study investigates possible reasons for this effect, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979-. One explanation is that education appears to have a double effect on the earnings of women. It increases their skills and productivity, as it does with men, and in addition it appears to reduce the gap in male and female earnings attributable to factors such as discrimination, tastes, and circumstances. The latter appear to account for about half of the differential in the returns to schooling.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This article addresses certain poor practices commonly seen in the applied health economics literature regarding the use of the Heckit and the two-part model. First, many articles invoke the Heckit to solve a supposed selection problem associated with masses of zero values in continuous variables, despite the fact that it has been shown elsewhere that no such selection problem exists when modeling observed actual, as opposed to latent potential, outcomes. Second, many applications incorrectly formulate the marginal effect tests in the Heckit and two-part model, thus undermining central conclusions. Finally, many researchers use a t-test of the inverse Mills coefficient to choose between the Heckit and two-part models despite its poor performace; we propose instead an adapted empirical mean square error test.},

This article shows that this cognitive-affective processing disposition undermines intimate relationships. Study 1 describes a measure that operationalizes the anxious-expectations component of rejection sensitivity. Study 2 provides experimental evidence that people who anxiously expect rejection readily perceive intentional rejection in the ambiguous behavior of others. Study 3 shows that people who enter romantic relationships with anxious expectations of rejection readily perceive intentional rejection in the insensitive behavior of their new partners. Study 4 demonstrates that rejection-sensitive people and their romantic partners are dissatisfied with their relationships. Rejection-sensitive men's jealousy and rejection-sensitive women's hostility and diminished supportiveness help explain their partners' dissatisfaction.

While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good.},

Moreover, we find that students with better high-school grades react more strongly to tuition fees. This might have important effects on the composition of students across states.},

The experiment is designed to compare the response of donors to subsidies in the form of matching amounts or rebated amounts. Matching subsidies are used by many corporations as an employee benefit; the US federal tax system encourages giving using a rebate subsidy by making donations tax deductible. The design includes a control group and two levels of subsidy of each type. Our main result is that matching subsidies result in larger total donations to charities than rebate subsidies, a result that is qualitatively similar to the lab findings. The estimated price elasticities for the matching subsidy are very similar to (and insignificantly different from) the lab experiments, while rebate subsidies lead to lower contributions in the field than in the lab. Since rebates in the field involve substantial lags and additional complications as compared with the "instant rebates" of the lab, this latter difference is not unexpected. The matching results are an important step in validating lab estimates of responsiveness to subsidies of charitable giving.},

Members of the social networking service Facebook express positive support to content on the website by clicking a Like button. We set up a natural field experiment to test whether users are more prone to support content if someone else has done so before. To find out to what extent conformity depends on group size and social ties we use three different treatment conditions: (1) one stranger has Liked the content, (2) three strangers have Liked the content, and (3) a friend has Liked the content. The results show that one Like from a single stranger had no impact. However, increasing the size of the influencing group doubled the probability that subjects expressed positive support. Friendship ties were also decisive. People were, on average, four times more likely to press the Like button if a friend, rather than a stranger, had done so before them. The existence of threshold effects in our experiment clearly shows that both group size and social proximity matters when opinions are shaped.},

Current policies and programs are largely driven by three implicit theories of why people do and do not save: trait theory, life cycle, and education. The authors' purpose is not to identify a singular best theory but rather to demonstrate the need to expand the theories used to address the retirement savings problem. Toward that end, they empirically examine each traditional theory and simultaneously explore the additional power of complementary theories: future-self theory and imagery. The results show that variables grounded in trait theory, life cycle, and education are significantly related to retirement planning. Moreover, people who reported greater and more vivid imagery of a positive future retired self had engaged in more retirement preparation, accounting for a significant amount of variance beyond the traditional theories.}

Yet many real life situations involve insiders, who are directly affected by a dilemma, and outsiders, who may be harmed if the insiders overcome the dilemma. The quintessential illustration is oligopoly. If insiders overcome their dilemma and collude, this inflicts harm on the opposite market side. In our experiment, harm on outsiders significantly reduces conditional cooperation of insiders. We can exclude that this result is driven by inequity aversion, reciprocity or efficiency seeking. Only guilt aversion can rationalize our findings, with guilt being most pronounced if the active insiders not only inflict harm on the outsider, but increase their own payoff at the expense of the outsider.},

  abstract = {Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other. Why? Two reasons seem likely: Either solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers, or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections. To examine the experience of connecting to strangers, we instructed commuters on trains and buses to connect with a stranger near them, to remain disconnected, or to commute as normal (Experiments 1a and 2a). In both contexts, participants reported a more positive (and no less productive) experience when they connected than when they did not. Separate participants in each context, however, expected precisely the opposite outcome, predicting a more positive experience in solitude (Experiments 1b and 2b). This mistaken preference for solitude stems partly from underestimating others' interest in connecting (Experiments 3a and 3b), which in turn keeps people from learning the actual consequences of social interaction (Experiments 4a and 4b). The pleasure of connection seems contagious: In a laboratory waiting room, participants who were talked to had equally positive experiences as those instructed to talk (Experiment 5). Human beings are social animals. Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own well-being.

H\"aggstr\"om (2008) defined a measure of instability of matchings and proved that under a certain partner search heuristic, outcomes are likely to have low instability. They also showed that with regards to stability, the preference structure known as common preferences lie somewhere in between the extreme cases of homotypic and antithetical preferences. Following up on this theoretical work, we let human subjects search for a good partner in a computer game where preferences were set to be either common, homotypic, or antithetical. We find that total search effort and instability of the outcome vary in the predicted ways with the preference structure and the number of agents. A set of simulations show that these results are consistent with a model where agents use a simple search heuristic with a slight possibility of error.}

In Studies 1-3, participants rated their emotional reactions (distress and sympathy toward the victims), perceived impact of helping, perceived responsibility to help, and helping motivation toward four versions of a helping situation. Gradually increasing victim identifiability in the helping situations primarily affected emotional reactions and sympathy completely mediated the IVE. Gradually making the reference-group smaller primarily affected perceived impact, and impact completely mediated the PDE. Gradually increasing in-groupness primarily affected perceived responsibility, and responsibility completely mediated the IGE. Study 4 included real monetary allocations and largely replicated the results using a between-subject design. Together, the results shed light on how contextual factors trigger help motivation, and indicate that different helping effects are primarily mediated by different mechanisms.},

This paper extends existing research on financial sophistication by utilizing an ethnographic study conducted over a 5-year time period. Results indicate that while some of the traditional categories of decision errors defined in earlier research affect consumers, decision errors not thoroughly examined in previous academic studies can have a notable and growing effect on consumers' financial decisions. Emerging categories of financial decision errors are identified, and shifts in consumers' financial behavior resulting from the financial crisis are profiled.

Since the importance of such image concerns is normally unobserved, the answer is theoretically unclear, and corresponding empirical evidence is mixed. To help counter this ambiguity, this paper proposes that the importance of image concerns-such as the desire to appear prosocial and not to appear greedy-relates to individuals' volunteer reputations. Experimental results support this possibility. Individuals with past histories of volunteering are less responsive to image concerns if their histories are public, or if their prosocial tendencies are already known. Consistent with a decreased importance of appearing prosocial, they are less likely to volunteer. Consistent with a decreased importance of not appearing greedy, they are less likely to be discouraged by public incentives.}

When participants decide how to allocate money between themselves and charities, the reduced giving in response to lower metrics is more severe. This finding is consistent with participants overweighting their dislike of lower charity performance metrics as an excuse not to give.},

It takes into account that people evaluate the kindness of an action not only by its consequences but also by its underlying intention. The theory is in line with the relevant stylized facts of a wide range of experimental games, such as the ultimatum game, the gift-exchange game, a reduced best-shot game, the dictator game, the prisoner's dilemma, and public goods games. Furthermore, it predicts that identical consequences trigger different reciprocal responses in different environments. Finally, the theory explains why outcomes tend to be fair in bilateral interactions whereas extremely unfair distributions may arise in competitive markets.},

In collaboration with a charitable organization, we sent roughly 10,000 solicitation letters to potential donors. One-third of the letters contained no gift, one-third contained a small gift, and one-third contained a large gift. Treatment assignment was random. The results confirm the economic importance of gift exchange. Compared to the no gift condition, the relative frequency of donations increased by 17 percent if a small gift was included and by 75 percent for a large gift. The study extends the current body of research on gift exchange, which is almost exclusively confined to laboratory studies.},

  abstract = {Formal and informal institutions, such as laws and social norms, are pervasive in daily life. They help maintain cooperation by coordinating and constraining indi-viduals' behaviors. However, our understanding of the comparative benefits and the endogenous emergence of institutions remains limited. Here, we study the emer-gence and performance of sanctioning institutions in a public goods context when individuals are free to migrate between different institutions. We show experimen-tally that efficient peer and centralized sanctioning emerge as dominant institutions that immediately generate and maintain high levels of cooperation without much need for costly punishment. The quick establishment of high cooperation is due to both the self-selection of prosocial individuals into these institutions and the insti-tutions' intrinsically beneficial properties. In addition, voluntary migration into the centralized sanctioning institution leads to the selection of stable prosocial leaders who refrain from antisocial punishment, while remnants of antisocial punishment still exist under peer punishment. We thank Sam Bowles, Rob Boyd, Joe Henrich, and Pete Richerson for com-ments regarding the anthropology literature on small-scale societies. We are also thank Bj\"orn Bartling, Donja Darai, Holger Herz, and Fr\'ed\'eric Schneider for comments on an earlier draft and and Roberto We-ber for comments on several drafts.

We find that the majority (83\%) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17\%) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80\% of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate. Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30\% when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources.},

Our theory predicts that an increase in the rebate rate offered by a given charity relative to a substitute charity will shift donations away from the substitute charity, but this ``stealing'' effect is not expected when complementary charities are considered. Our model further characterizes the conditions under which total donations increase with rebates. We test the model in an experimental setting, and demonstrate that the experimental results support our theoretical predictions. We derive the demand for giving as rebates vary for both substitute and complementary causes. The social net benefit of rebates is calculated by comparing campaign costs with new donations generated.},

In this paper we investigate the role of social preferences and beliefs for voluntary coopera tion. Numerous public goods experiments have shown that many people contribute more to the public good than pure self-interest can easily explain. An equally important observation, how ever, is that free riding increases in repeatedly played public goods experiments across various parameters and participant pools.1 The facts are clear, but their explanation is not. An obvious candidate for explaining the decline of cooperation was learning the free-rider strategy. However, Andreoni (1988) showed that cooperation resumed after a restart, which is inconsistent with a pure learning argument. In a subsequent paper he interpreted the decline in cooperation "to be due to frustrated attempts at kindness, rather than learning the free-riding},

Conversely, if a mood management goal is accessible, happy people abstain from self-control tasks because the tasks are incompatible with this goal. This pattern receives consistent support across several self-control tasks, including donating to charity, demonstrating physical endurance, seeking negative feedback, and completing tests. Note (JEPR): "Fishbach and Labroo (2007) find that the effect of a positive mood on charitable giving is stronger when a participant is primed to think about long-term goals since giving to a charity 'serves the long-term goal of helping a charity campaign and the donor become a better perso'n"},

A major conclusion is that we are witnessing a simultaneous process of power concentration in importing countries, and power deconcentration in producing countries.

  abstract = {This paper presents evidence from a large-scale field experiment on conditional cooperation: people behave pro-socially depending on the pro-social behavior of other persons. When students were presented with the information that many others donated to two charitable funds at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, their willingness to contribute increased. This constitutes a first test of social interaction effects in charitable giving in a field experiment. The behavior resulting from conditional cooperation is consistent with at least three theoretical approaches: first, people may want to behave in an appropriate way and to conform to a social norm; second, people have some level of fairness preferences, such as reciprocity; or third, contributions by others may serve as a signal of the quality of the public good, or of the organization that provides the good. Results from previous experiments that attempt to discriminate among the various explanations are ambiguous. Some experimental studies indicate that conformity can explain conditional cooperation better than reciprocal considerations, while others come to the opposite conclusion. Yet other laboratory experiments find evidence supporting the third mechanism, that cooperative behavior of others is used as an indication of the quality of the public good.},

However, when a psychological contract exists between principals and agents, the agents perceive increased monitoring as an indication of distrust, and this induces them to reduce work effort. This "crowding out effect" is likely to dominate when the relationship between principals and agents is personal, while the "disciplining effect" is likely to dominate when the relationship is abstract, as in a competitive market setting. Empirical evidence from neighbouring sciences and from an econometric study supports this proposition.}

In a phenomenon that has been referred to as psychophysical numbing (PN), Fetherstonhaugh, Slovic, Johnson, and Friedrich (1997) found that participants rated an intervention saving a fixed number of lives to be less worth investing in when more total lives were at risk (i,e,, when saved lives represented a smaller proportion of the total threat or problem). In two new experi-ments, life-valuation correlates of PN responding, as well as manipulations of death salience, accountability, and economics focus, were explored in the context of stu-dents' willingness to support mandatory antilock brake requirements for new cars, PN responding was pervasive, but non-PN responders were clearly distinguished by the greater overall value they placed on saving lives. Salience and accountability manipu-lations did not debias judgments but did tend to rule out low-effort processing as an explanation for these quantity confusions. An emphasis on economic considerations was consistently related to greater PN responding. As participants in a larger social system, each of us is routinely called on to make judgments concerning the appropriateness of mandating risk-reducing and life-saving interventions. Many decisions of this type (e,g,, requiring costly auto safety features to prevent some number of injuries or deaths) have substantial con-sp,quences for consumers. How do we make such decisions? The dynamics influ-encing our choices are no doubt a complicated interplay of attitudes and ideology Requests for reprints should be sent to}

Understanding when and why it occurs is important both for the design of economic institutions and for modeling the evolution of cooperation. Our experiment shows that subjects will engage in costly punishment even when it will not be observed until the end of the session, which supports the view that agents enjoy punishment. Moreover, players continue to cooperate when punishment is unobserved, perhaps because they (correctly) anticipate that shirkers will be punished: Fear of punishment can be as effective at promoting contributions as punishment itself. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {New graduates of elite MBA programs flock to Wall Street during bull markets and start their careers elsewhere when the stock market is weak. Given the transferability of MBA skills, it seems likely that any effect of stock returns on MBA placement would be short-lived. In this paper, I use a survey of Stanford MBAs from the classes of 1960 through 1997 to analyze the relationship between the state of financial market at graduation, initial job placement, and long- term labor market outcomes. Using stock market conditions at graduation as an instrument for first job, I show that there is a strong causal effect of initial placement in investment banking on the likelihood of working on Wall Street anywhere from three to twenty years later. I then measure the investment banking compensation premium relative to other jobs and estimate the additional income generated by anMBA cohort where a higher fraction starts in higher-paid jobs relative to a cohort that starts in lower-paid areas. The results lead to several conclusions. First, random factors play an important role in determining the industries and incomes of members of this high-skill group. Second, there is a deep pool of potential investment bankers in any given Stanford MBA class. During the time these people are in school, factors beyond their control sort them into or out of banking upon graduation. Finally, industry-specificortask-specific human capital appears to be important for young investment bankers.}

  abstract = {A popular fundraising tool is donation matching, where every dollar is matched by a third party. But field experiments find that matching doesn't always increase donations. Individuals may believe that peers will exhaust the matching funds, so their donation isn't pivotal. We develop a theory of how beliefs about peers' donations affect one's likelihood of donation. We test our theory using novel ``threshold match'' treatments in field and laboratory experiments. One ``threshold match'' treatment more than doubles the donation rate relative to no match. To understand the mechanism behind this increase, we use a lab study to show that beliefs about peers' donations matter. Our theoretical, lab, and field results combined suggest people are more likely to donate when they believe they are more pivotal to securing matching money. Beliefs about others matter, and they should be taken into account when trying to increase donations.}

One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean {$\pm$}1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option\textemdash an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file\textemdash so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

Normal(\textmu, {$\sigma$} 2) and X n = 1 n n i=1 X i (1.2a) S 2 n = 1 n - 1 n i=1 (X i - X n) 2 (1.2b) Pivotal quantities allow the construction of exact confidence intervals, mean-ing they have exactly the stated confidence level, as opposed to so-called " asymp-totic " or " large-sample " confidence intervals which only have approximately the stated confidence level and that only when the sample size is large. An exact confidence interval is valid for any sample size. An asymptotic confidence in-terval is valid only for sufficiently large sample size (and typically one does not know how large is large enough). Exact intervals are constructed as follows. \textbullet{} Find a pivotal quantity g(X, \$\th eta\$). \textbullet{} Find upper and lower confidence limits on the pivotal quantity, that is, numbers c 1 and c 2 such that Pr\{c 1 \textbackslash textless g(X, \$\th eta\$) \textbackslash textless c 2 \} = {$\gamma$} (1.3) where {$\gamma$} is the desired confidence coefficient. 1 \textbullet{} Solve the inequalities: the confidence set (usually an interval) is \{ \$\th eta\$ {$\in$} {$\Theta$} : c 1 \textbackslash textless g(X, \$\th eta\$) \textbackslash textless c 2 \} (1.4) The point is that the probability (1.3) does not depend on the parameter \$\th eta\$ by definition of " pivotal quantity. " If g(X, \$\th eta\$) were not pivotal, then the probability (1.3) would depend on the unknown true parameter value and could not be calculated. The constants c 1 and c 2 in (1.3) are called critical values. They are obtained from a table for the distribution of the pivotal quantity or from a computer program.}

Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or "dragons of inaction": limited cognition about the problem, ideological worldviews that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers.},

Yet, such discounting varies according to several factors. This paper isolates one of these factors: the cost of advice. Specifically, three experiments investigate whether the cost of advice, independent of its quality, affects how people use advice. The studies use the Judge-Advisor System (JAS) to investigate whether people value advice from others more when it costs money than when it is free, and examine the psychological processes that could account for this effect. The results show that people use paid advice significantly more than free advice and suggest that this effect is due to the same forces that have been documented in the literature to explain the sunk costs fallacy. Implications for circumstances under which people value others' opinions are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a \$1:\$1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80\% (or 94\%) and total donations by 75\% (or 89\%) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.},

  abstract = {How does setting a donation option as the default in a charitable appeal affect people's decisions? In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large- scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of "choice- option" defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a "scale-back" effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a lower-bar" effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a "default- distraction" effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However, the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a "self- canceling" intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue. The authors discuss the implications of the findings for research on fundraising specifically, for choice architecture and behavioral interventions more generally, and for the use of "nudges" in policy decisions.}

However, it is not clear how research has addressed this issue and how much is know about retirement saving decisions. With this paper, we provided two major contributions to the literature on retirement saving. As a starting point, we developed a general chart of retirement saving choices, extending the work of Hurd and Panis (2006). These authors focused exclusively on choices at job change or retirement age and we extended their diagram to all main decisions at each stage of retirement saving, providing a more comprehensive framework. We then used this diagram as the yardstick to perform the systematic review and evaluate the breadth of research in the last 20 years. We found 130 papers and identified the most studied retirement choices and the under- researched areas. Most papers focused on asset allocation, decision to save and contribution rate. Less attention was given to decisions at retirement age and voluntary savings. Furthermore, very few papers studied the psychological and social influences in retirement saving decisions. Policy implications and future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {A person's willingness to sacrifice for others is highly sensitive to informational conditions, but it is unclear why. I conceptually and experimentally distinguish between three leading explanations, all based upon beliefs about the giver, which previous work has not adequately distinguished. 1) Social-signaling holds that a person wants others to think of her as fair- minded, 2) self-signaling says she would like to think of herself that way, and 3) beliefs-based altruism says that she cares about how her action makes another person feel. I present a model in which the decision-maker signals her preferences to an observer, which can correspond to each of these motivations. I experimentally test these interpretations using the model's predictions about a dictator game in which the outcome may be determined either by the dictator's choice or by chance. Limiting the recipient's ability to infer the dictator's choice lowers the frequency of giving, which is evidence of either social-signaling or beliefs-based altruism. However, I find little willingness to pay to in uence a recipient's beliefs about how he was treated by a third-party dictator, providing little support for belief-based altruism, and revealing partial information about the dictator's identity, while holding constant the recipient's information about his treatment, increases the frequency and amount of giving, suggesting social-signaling. Finally, lowering the expected cost of the decision to give by decreasing the likelihood that it will be implemented has little effect on dictator giving when the beliefs of the recipient are held constant, offering little support for self-signaling. This suggests that the act of giving is largely tied to what it says to others about the giver, as opposed to the self, or how it makes the recipient feel.},

We use data from the first stage to choose a conditional treatment assignment rule for units in the second stage of the experiment. This amounts to choosing the propensity score, the conditional probability of treatment given covariates. We propose to select the propensity score to minimize the asymptotic variance bound for estimating the average treatment effect. Our procedure can be implemented simply using standard statistical software and has attractive large-sample properties.},

It is important to know what the return on educational investments might be since a high return implies that there might be too little of such investments. The major preoccupation in this literature has been attempting to unravel the simultaneous relationship between schooling and wages. That is, wages depend on schooling since schooling enhances human capital, but schooling decisions depend on wages for one or more of a number of reasons - for example, individuals will invest in more schooling the greater is the return to that schooling. Traditional estimates of the return to an additional year of schooling in the UK suggest that this is in of the order of 7\%. However, the results here suggest much larger figures - perhaps in the order of 20\%. We use a large sample of UK males to address the potential endogeneity of schooling. By exploiting the experimental nature of two changes in the minimum school leaving age to uncover the effect of an exogenous increase in schooling on wages. Our results confirm recent US work. For example, Card (1993) and Butcher and Case (1994) suggest that the estimates of schooling returns using such methods are almost double that of simple least squares methods. However, the results here provide much greater precision than has previously been the case and so substantiate the US evidence of much larger rates of return to education than traditionally thought.},

On the other hand, revealed altruism could be lower if subjects are more altruistic toward the residual claimant than they are toward the agent to whom they are being asked to give. We demonstrate this point with simple laboratory experiments that derive from popular recent designs. We find a significant effect from the hypothesized confound, with revealed altruism dependent upon who is specified as the residual claimant.},

We exploit hundreds of regression discontinuities from the centralized, score-based admissions system to estimate the causal impacts of interest.

Returns are highly heterogeneous by field of study, with large returns in health, law and social science, as well as selective technology and business degrees. We find small to negative returns in arts, humanities and education degrees. We do not find evidence that vocational curriculum focus increases returns for less selective degrees.

One is that people are financially illiterate since they lack understanding of simple economic concepts and cannot carry out computations such as computing compound interest, which could cause them to make suboptimal financial decisions. A second is that impatience or present-bias might explain suboptimal financial decisions. That is, some people persistently choose immediate gratification instead of taking advantage of larger long-term payoffs. We use experimental evidence from Chile to explore how these factors appear related to poor financial decisions. Our results show that our measure of impatience is a strong predictor of wealth and investment in health. Financial literacy is also correlated with wealth though it appears to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions. Policymakers interested in enhancing retirement wellbeing would do well to consider the importance of these factors.},

The main analytical innovations are the reconsideration of the labor supply decision in a state of Keynesian involuntary unemployment as a choice between work and, not leisure, but inferior production activities; and the application of Pigou and Robinson's theory of employer monopsony, leading to a focus on the "local fair trade organization", which has a similar effect to a labor union or minimum wage in eliminating monopsony rents. A price premium is found neither necessary nor sufficient for fair trade, and in a state of involuntary unemployment a premium does not lead to inefficient allocation. The conclusion is that fair trade improves welfare by strengthening competition for labor, and should be encouraged as a complementary element of an enlightened trade liberalization policy.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies regress log earnings on schooling and report estimated coefficients as `Mincer rates of return'. A more recent literature uses instrumental variables. This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns. Accounting for uncertainty affects estimates of rates of return. Accounting for sequential revelation of information calls into question the validity of the internal rate of return as a tool for policy analysis. An alternative approach to computing economic rates of return that accounts for sequential revelation of information is proposed and the evidence is summarized. We distinguish ex ante from ex post returns. New panel data methods for estimating the uncertainty and psychic costs facing agents are reviewed. We report recent evidence that demonstrates that there are large psychic costs of schooling. This helps to explain why persons do not attend school even though the financial rewards for doing so are high. We present methods for computing distributions of returns ex ante and ex post. We review the literature on instrumental variable estimation. The link of the estimates to the economics is not strong. The traditional instruments are weak, and this literature has not produced decisive empirical estimates. We exposit new methods that interpret the economic content of different instruments within a unified framework.},

Research on excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of immediate rewards by precommitting to decisions or elaborating the value of future rewards both can make decisions more future oriented. The authors explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with present and future rewards but with present and future selves. In line with research that shows that people may fail, because of a lack of belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves, the authors propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources to the future. In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who interacted with their virtual future selves exhibited an increased tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.

In this article, the author looks for two alternative phenomena using a large panel data set gathered from nonprofit organizations' tax returns. First, the author looks for crowding out in the opposite direction: increased private funding may cause reduced public funding. Second, the author tests whether one type of funding acts as a signal of charity quality and thus crowds in other funding. The author finds evidence that government grants crowd in private donations. Crowding in is larger for younger charities. This is consistent with signaling, if donors know less about younger charities and the signal value is stronger. The author finds no evidence of an effect of private donations on government grants. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2012.}

  abstract = {Abstract It has traditionally been assumed that the socially available amount X of a public good is the simple sum of the separate amounts x i produced by the i = 1, ..., I members of the community. But there are many other possibilities of practical importance. Among them are: (i) Weakest-link rule, where the socially available amount is the minimum of the quantities individually provided, and (ii) Best-shot rule, where the socially available amount is the maximum of the individual quantities. The former tends to arise in linear situations, where each individual has a veto on the total to be provided (e.g., if each is responsible for one link of a chain); the latter tends to arise when there is a single prize of overwhelming importance for the community, with any individual's effort having a chance of securing the prize. In comparison with the standard Summation formula of ordinary public-good theory, it is shown that underprovision of the public good tends to considerably moderated when the Weakest-link function is applicable, but aggravated when the Best-shot function is applicable. In time of disaster, where the survival of the community may depend upon each person's doing his duty, the conditions for applicability of the Weakest-link rule are approximated. This circumstance explains the historical observation that disaster conditions tend to elicit an extraordinary amount of unselfish behavior.},

Nonetheless, we show that ostracism can be effective in promoting cooperation with either finite or infinite rounds of play. The model can be applied to games other than the Prisoners' Dilemma, and ostracism can enforce inefficient as well as efficient outcomes. \textcopyright{} 1989.}

A crucial question is why do we trust people more who cooperate without calculating the costs? We propose a game theory model to explain this phenomenon. One player has the option to "look" at the costs of cooperation, and the other player chooses whether to continue the interaction. If it is occasionally very costly for player 1 to cooperate, but defection is harmful for player 2, then cooperation without looking is a subgame perfect equilibrium. This behavior also emerges in population-based processes of learning or evolution. Our theory illuminates a number of key phenomena of human interactions: authentic altruism, why people cooperate intuitively, one-shot cooperation, why friends do not keep track of favors, why we admire principled people, Kant's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative, taboos, and love.},

  abstract = {This paper considers estimation of truncated and censored regression models with fixed effects in panel data. Up until now, no estimator has been shown to be consistent as the cross section dimension increases with the time dimension fixed. Trimmed least absolute deviations (LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead, the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in small samples. Despite their nonlinear nature, the estimators are easy to calculate in practice, as are consistent estimators of their asymptotic variances. Generalization of the estimators to panels of arbitrary length is briefly discussed.},

This is despite the fact that selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that these low-income students' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts who have similar achievement. The latter group generally follows the advice to apply to a few "par" colleges, a few "reach" colleges, and a couple of "safety" schools. We separate the low-income, high-achieving students into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts ("achievement-typical" behavior) and those whose apply to no selective institutions ("income-typical" behavior). We show that income-typical students do not come from families or neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged than those of achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, the income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher or schoolmate from an older cohort who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely-used policies-college admissions staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs-are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students, and we suggest policies that will be effective must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.},

  abstract = {Some social institutions reveal participants' behavior in the aggregate, while concealing the identities of the participants. For example, individual church donations may be kept anonymous, while the total amount raised is publicized. This presents a puzzle in light of recent evidence that anonymity reduces contributions. We offer an explanation for this puzzle in the context of a model of costly signaling with two types of agents: conditionally cooperative (" good" ) and uncooperative (" bad" ). We consider costly participation in a community activity (e.g., tithing) as a signal of an individual's type. By signaling the presence of one more good type, this may lead other good types to contribute more in future, more important, collective goods problems (CGP's). Thus, if good types also value others' contributions more than bad types, good types gain more from sending the signal. But if those who do not signal face exclusion, the signal would need to be made very costly to dissuade bad types from signaling. In contrast, if the institution is anonymous, so that it reveals only the total number of signals, then while signals cannot be used to exclude bad types, even an inexpensive signal may succeed in revealing the total number of good types. This informationhelps good types maximize the conditional cooperation component of their utility in the CGP, and under specified conditions, can increase expected CGP contributions. We characterize conditions under which an anonymous signaling institution increases expected welfare. We provide examples of institutions that may yield such benefits, including religion, music and dance, voting, charitable donations, and military traditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this case, IV produces a local average treatment effect (LATE), and if monotonicity does not hold, then no effect of interest is identified. In this paper, I calculate the weighted average of treatment effects that is identified under general first-stage effect heterogeneity, which is generally not the average treatment effect among those affected by the instrument. I then describe a simple set of data-driven approaches to modeling variation in the effect of the instrument. These approaches identify a Super-Local Average Treatment Effect (SLATE) that weights treatment effects by the corresponding instrument effect more heavily than LATE. Even when first-stage heterogeneity is poorly modeled, these approaches considerably reduce the impact of small-sample bias compared to standard IV and unbiased weak-instrument IV methods, and can also make results more robust to violations of monotonicity. In application to a published study with a strong instrument, the preferred approach reduces error by about 19\% in small ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$} {$\approx$} 1, 000) subsamples, and by about 13\% in larger ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$} {$\approx$} 33, 000) subsamples.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Estimating the cost or benefit of military service is complicated by the complex selection that determines who eventually serves in the military: On the one hand, potential conscripts have to pass medical and psychological examinations before entering the military, and on the other hand numerous (temporary) exemptions exist that can be manipulated by young men to avoid military service. We use substantial, policy-induced variation in aggregate military enrollment rates to deal with these selection issues. We find that approximately 10 years after serving in the military former conscripts have earnings that are on average 5\% lower than the earnings of members of their birth cohort who did not serve in the military. These findings are shown to be robust against a variety of specifications.},

I also discuss the potential outcome framework developed by Rubin and coauthors, building on work by Neyman. I then discuss the relative merits of these approaches for empirical work in economics, focusing on the questions each answer well, and why much of the the work in economics is closer in spirit to the potential outcome framework.},

They find that the attractiveness of a risky asset depends upon investors' time horizon: consistently with MLA, individuals are more willing to take risks when they evaluate their investments less frequently. This paper shows that these experimental findings can be accommodated by a standard version of Expected Utility Theory, namely a CRRA functional, provided that, consistently with MLA, we impose narrow bracketing. We use four different datasets to estimate two CRRA and two MLA functionals, together with binary mixture models of all combinations of the competing models. Our econometric exercise supports our theoretical claim on narrow bracketing and finds little evidence of subjects' loss aversion.

We demonstrate that socially optimal restaurant meals are larger than average home-cooked meals, yet the choice to "super-size" alleviates the size discrepancy.

  abstract = {Humans frequently cooperate without carefully weighing the costs and benefits. As a result, people may wind up cooperating when it is not worthwhile to do so.Why risk making costly mistakes? Here, we present experimental evidence that reputation concerns provide an answer: people cooperate in an uncalculating way to signal their trustworthiness to observers. We present two economic game experiments in which uncalculating versus calculating decisionmaking is operationalized by either a subject's choice of whether to reveal the precise costs of cooperating (Exp. 1) or the time a subject spends considering these costs (Exp. 2). In both experiments, we find that participants are more likely to engage in uncalculating cooperation when their decision-making process is observable to others. Furthermore, we confirm that people who engage in uncalculating cooperation are perceived as, and actually are, more trustworthy than people who cooperate in a calculating way. Taken together, these data provide the first empirical evidence, to our knowledge, that uncalculating cooperation is used to signal trustworthiness, and is not merely an efficient decision-making strategy that reduces cognitive costs. Our results thus help to explain a range of puzzling behaviors, such as extreme altruism, the use of ethical principles, and romantic love.}

One of these has been successfully used to halt this kind of unraveling in a number of labor markets, while the other has failed. When it is costly for firms and workers to be mismatched compared with the costs of matching early, the experimental observations reproduce the field observations. Furthermore, the experiment permits us to observe the transition between a decentralized and a centralized market, both when the centralized market fails to control unraveling and when it succeeds, at a level of detail unavailable in field data.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1979 The Econometric Society},

We consider the problem of optimal treatment assignment in an experiment with several cross-sectional waves where the goal is to choose among a set of possible policies (treatments) for large-scale implementation. We show that optimal experimental designs learn from early waves by assigning more experimental units to the better-performing treatments in later waves. We discuss a computation-ally tractable approximation of the optimal design, based on a modification of Thompson sampling. Calibrated simulations and theoretical results demonstrate improvements in welfare, relative to conventional designs as well as standard Thompson sampling. Our setting is related to but different from multi-armed bandit settings. The focus on the highest-performing policies is not driven by an "exploitation" motive, but by optimal learning about the best policy choice.},

We suggest that competition affects trust not only within dyads including direct competitors, but also between individuals who do not compete against each other. We test this idea in a trust game where trustors and trustees are rewarded based either on their absolute performance or on how well they do relative to players from other dyads. In Experiment 1, we show that competition among trustors significantly increases trust. Competition among trustees decreases trustworthiness, but trustors do not anticipate this effect. In Experiment 2, we additionally show that the increase in trust under competition is caused by a combination of increased risk taking and lower sensitivity to non-financial concerns specific to trust interactions. Our results suggest that tournament incentives might have a ``blinding effect'' on considerations such as betrayal and inequality aversion.}

We solicit donations from 32,174 alumni of an Ivy League university, including thousands of rich and powerful alumni. Consistent with past psychology research, we find that the rich and powerful respond dramatically, and differently than others, to being given a sense of agency over the use of donated funds. Gifts from rich and powerful alumni increase by 100\%\textendash 350\% when they are given a sense of agency. This response arises primarily on the intensive margin with no effect on the likelihood of donating. Results suggest that motivating the rich and powerful to act may require tailored interventions.}

We show that individuals are more likely to donate when a facet of their identity associated with a norm of generosity is primed in an appeal. In large charitable giving field experiments run by the American Red Cross, appeals that prime an individual's identity as a previous donor to the charity or as a member of a local community generate more donations. The primes are more effective when they highlight a facet of the potential donor's identity that we hypothesize to be more relevant to his sense of self: priming identity as a previous donor is more effective for more regular donors and priming identity as a local community member is more effective for people in smaller communities. Together, these results elucidate the impact of identity on behavior and demonstrate how identity primes can be implemented in practice to encourage public good provision.

In this paper, we propose face as a key variable that can explain much of the complexity of social interactions in Asian organizations. We attempted to elaborate on the concept and dynamics of face in Asia in such a way as to capture its pervasive, significant but often subtle influences on organizational behavior. We also examined conditions, functions, and consequences of face dynamics to generate testable propositions for future research. We argue that scholars have to go beyond the individualistic assumptions about human behavior implicit in theories of organizational behavior in the West to better understand the richness of organizational behavior in Asia. In Asia, organizational behavior is better predicted by an individual's external attributes such as face than internal attributes such as desires, emotions, and cognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Why do individuals choose different types of post-secondary education, and what are the labor market consequences of those choices? We investigate these questions in the context of Norway's post-secondary education system. Our analysis is based on a generalized Roy model where individuals can choose between multiple fields of study. To overcome the challenge of selection bias, we take advantage of Norway's centralized admission process that covers almost all universities and colleges. This process creates discontinuities which effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different fields of study. From the students' applications, we know their ranking of fields and can therefore construct relevant counterfactuals. Our empirical findings may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, we find that different fields have widely different payoffs. For example, by choosing engineering instead of teaching, individuals more than double the earnings they receive. By comparison, choosing humanities or nursing instead of teaching has little payoff. Second, when disentangling the causal contribution of field of study and institution, we find that field of study drives the heterogeneity in payoffs to post-secondary education. Third, individuals tend to choose fields in which they have comparative and absolute advantage. In contrast, a choice model with one-factor ability-as-IQ is inconsistent with the pattern of selection we estimate. Our study has important implications for the policy debate over mismatch and market frictions in the supply and demand for post-secondary field of study, and for the literature on how to model and correct for selection bias when there are many unordered alternatives.}

  abstract = {Empirical policy research often focuses on causal inference. Since policy choices seem to depend on understanding the counterfactual-what happens with and without a policy-this tight link of causality and policy seems natural. While this link holds in many cases, we argue that there are also many policy applications where causal inference is not central, or even necessary. Consider two toy examples. One policy maker facing a drought must decide whether to invest in a rain dance to increase the chance of rain. Another seeing clouds must deciding whether to take an umbrella to work to avoid getting wet on the way home? Both decisions could benefit from an empirical duty of rain. But each has different requirements of the estimator. One requires causality: do rain dances cause rain? The other does not, needing only prediction: is the chance of rain high enough to merit an umbrella? We often focus on rain dance like policy problems. But there are many important policy problems umbrella-like. Not only are these prediction problems neglected, machine learning can help us solve them more effectively. In this paper, we (i) provide a simple framework that clarifies the distinction between causation and prediction; (ii) explain how machine learning adds value over traditional regression approaches in solving prediction problems; (iii) provide an empirical example from health policy to illustrate how improved predictions can generate large social impact; (iv) illustrate how "umbrella" problems are common and important in many important policy domains; and (v) argue that solving these problems produces not just policy impact but also theoretical and economic insights. 1 * Obermeyer: zobermeyer@partners.org. 1 A longer version of this paper-Kleinberg et al. (2015a)-fleshes out each of these points, providing greater detail on the model, the empirical work and a more through summary of machine learning.},

We utilize a special feature at the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE): occasional shifts of securities from daily to weekly trading. If investors' decisions are influenced by trading frequency manipulation, then returns should be predictably affected. MLA results in a negative relation between risk aversion and the length of the evaluation period. Thus, the longer the evaluation period is, the lower the expected return is. This intuition also suggests reduced sensitivity to economic events in longer evaluation periods. We find strong support for MLA in the marketplace when testing expected return, as well as return sensitivity.}

Contrary to previous research, we find that reducing the ``price of altruism'' by increasing matching efficiency has a significantly stronger effect on females than on males.}

A sample of 134 economists completed a self-report survey examining the decision process of different decision contexts in life, including pension decisions. Overall, participants showed low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a private pension plan, compared to their motivation to engage in other decision tasks. However, economists invested more in the decision process and showed greater satisfaction from their decision regarding their pension plan when they had a more positive perception of pensions. This perception is represented by higher subjective likelihood of receiving pension allowances for a long period, and by a profitable view of the balance between current payments and expected incomes from pension saving.},

  abstract = {Why do people engage in charitable giving? Certainly there are many reasons for this. Social norms, social perceptions, religious convictions, and other considerations may all play a role. However, beyond all those reasons, the wish to help other people, particularly when those people are in need of external help, is the core motivation for charitable giving and helping behavior. Thus, in order to better understand the psychological motivation of charitable giving, it is important to explore the factors that may increase or decrease the fundamental wish to extend help. One of the main factors that affects the wish to aid is the characteristics of the target\textemdash the recipient of the help. Why do some targets elicit outpourings of sympathy and aid, while other targets do not? In this chapter we review experimental and theoretical work on the effect of victims identifiability on charitable giving. We integrate recent findings, concentrating on the psychological processes underlying the effect and its boundary conditions.},

I bound and estimate average treatment effects for always takers and never takers by extending marginal treatment effect methods. I use these methods to separate selection from treatment effect heterogeneity, generalizing the comparison of OLS to LATE. Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, I find that the treatment effect of insurance on emergency room utilization decreases from always takers to compliers to never takers. Previous utilization explains a large share of the treatment effect heterogeneity. Extrapolations show that other expansions could increase or decrease utilization.},

However, not all individuals are equally able-or motivated-to recompense others satisfactorily. As such, reciprocity relies greatly on the capacities and motives of partners. Apparent health may provide a cue to the value of potential exchange partners in this regard: healthier individuals will tend to live longer and accrue more, higher quality resources, thus increasing the incentives for mutual cooperation. In a monetary exchange task, we show that the apparent health of partners' faces affects human reciprocity. Specifically, participants were more willing to return a profitable amount to, but not more willing to invest in, apparently healthy than unhealthy partners. This effect appears to be a function of the attractiveness of apparent health, suggesting a preference for repayment of attractive partners. Furthermore, the effect of apparent health on reciprocal exchange is qualified by the sex of the partners, implicating a history of sexual selection in the evolution of human social exchange. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The basic assumption is that social (other-regarding) preferences, such as shame and compassion, is a function of previously offered incentive schemes. I show that it may be optimal to offer incentives based on relative performance evaluation (RPE) in both periods in the dynamic (two-period) setting, even if team incentives, i.e. joint performance evaluation (JPE) is optimal in the static setting, and vice versa. The model also suggests that dynamic preferences promote the use of JPE or RPE at the expense of independent performance evaluation (IPE) if the principal cannot use IPE to boost social preferences.}

We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment, through a survey administered to 467 blood donors in an Italian town, and found that donors are not reluctant to receive compensation in general; a substantial share of respondents declared that they would stop being donors if given 10 Euros in cash, but we do not find such effects when a voucher of the same nominal value is offered instead. The aversion to direct cash payments is particularly marked among women, but does not emerge among individuals who have only recently become donors. All of our findings are robust to regression analyses. Implications for research and public policy are discussed.},

We approached nearly 5000 households, randomly divided into four experimental treatments, to shed light on key issues on the demand side of charitable fund-raising. Empirical results are in line with our theory: in gross terms, the lotteries raised more money than the voluntary contributions treatments. Interestingly, in terms of both maximizing current contributions and inducing participation, we find that a one-standard deviation increase in female solicitor physical attractiveness is similar to that of the lottery incentive.}

However, there is little evidence of the effect of changes in teachers' incentives in schools. In this paper, I present evidence from an experimental program that offered teachers bonus payments on thebasis of the performance of their classes in high-school matriculation exams in English and mathematics. The bonus program was structured as a rank-order tournament among teachers, separately by subject. Thus, teachers were rewarded on the basis of their performance relative to other teachers of the same subjects. Two measurements of student achievements were used as indicators of teachers' performance: the pass rate and the average score on each matriculation exam. The total amount awarded in each tournament was predetermined, and individual awards were determined on the basis of rank and an award scale. The main interest in this experiment relates to the effect of the program on teachers' pedagogy and effort, on teacher's productivity as measured by students' achievements, and on teachers' grading ethics.}

Across four studies, we reveal that in cases of realistic tradeoffs in social distance for gains in welfare where helping socially distant others necessitates not helping socially closer others with the same resources, helping is deemed as less morally acceptable. Making helping decisions at a cost to socially closer others also negatively affects judgments of relationship quality (Study 2) and in turn, decreases cooperative behavior with the helper (Study 3). Ruling out an alternative explanation of physical distance accounting for the effects in Studies 1 to 3, social distance continued to impact moral acceptability when physical distance across social targets was matched (Study 4). These findings reveal that attempts to decrease biases in helping may have previously unconsidered consequences for moral judgments, relationships, and cooperation.},

We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement\textemdash defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs\textemdash with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality\textemdash like humor and emotion\textemdash is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content\textemdash like mentions of price and deals\textemdash is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality\textendash related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers' path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook's EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook's behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality\textendash related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodology we apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.},

Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited.}

In this study I resolve the ambiguity for consumers and quantify the benefit for a firm. I describe a model of price discrimination that includes both second-degree and third-degree price discrimination. Using data from a Broadway play, I estimate the structural model and conduct various experiments to investigate the implications of alternative pricing policies. The observed price discrimination may improve the firm's profit by approximately 5\%, relative to uniform pricing, while the difference for aggregate consumer welfare is negligible. Also, I show that the gain from changing prices in the face of fluctuating demand is small under the observed price discrimination.}

Levin's (see record 1972-22883-001) study by examining the effects of a person's positive affective state on his or her subsequent helpfulness to others in 2 experiments. The studies were conducted in divergent locations of a large eastern city, and Ss differed in ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics. As in the earlier investigation, "good mood" was induced by the discovery of a dime in the coin return of a public telephone. The dependent measure in the present experiments, however, was willingness to mail a sealed and addressed letter which had been left at the telephone, apparently by accident. Both stamped and unstamped letters were used. Results support the prediction that those finding a dime would be more helpful, even though all Ss saw the letter and even though the help did not involve interpersonal interaction.

I estimate the effects of social media news exposure by conducting a large field experiment randomly offering participants subscriptions to conservative or liberal news outlets on Facebook. I collect data on the causal chain of media effects: subscriptions to outlets, exposure to news on Facebook, visits to online news sites and sharing of posts, as well as changes in political opinions and attitudes. Four main findings emerge. First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the news sites individuals visit. Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party. Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leaning of news outlets affects political opinions. Fourth, Facebook's algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them (a ``filter bubble''). Together, these results suggest that social media algorithms are increasing polarization by limiting exposure to counter-attitudinal news.},

One significant gap between experimental settings and the real world is the way in which individuals earn the incomes that they use for charitable donations. This study examined the relationship between individuals' income sources and their charitable giving decisions. To do so, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 188 college students and asked them to donate with windfall money or with money earned from a real task, respectively. The findings showed that participants donated more to charities if their funds derived from windfall gains. Implications for conducting experiments and motivating donors are also discussed.}

The juxtaposition of the designer coffee boom and rock-bottom raw material prices strikes market critics as compelling evidence of unfairness and exploitation.

The coffee market is clearly far from the textbook model of frictionless efficiency. Its adjustment of supply and demand is subject to long lags and overshooting. Nevertheless, the story of the current coffee glut is at bottom a story of falling costs and productivity improvements on both the supply and the demand sides. In particular, prices have fallen so low primarily because of dramatically expanded production by low-cost suppliers in Brazil and Vietnam. And those low prices are a signal to high-cost producers\textemdash for example, in Central America\textemdash to supply a higher-value product or exit the market. However well-intentioned, interventionist schemes to lift prices above market levels ignore those market realities. Accordingly, they are doomed to end in failure\textemdash or to offer cures that are worse than the disease.

  abstract = {Numerous recommendations for improving the dependability of research findings in psychological science have emerged in recent years. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations proves problematic for advancing uniform solutions to improve research dependability by individuals within and across the various constituencies that comprise psychological science. Moreover, several dependability recommen-dations propose practices to address the problem of false positive findings that can inversely increase the problem of false negative findings, and vice versa. It is proposed that the solution to this conundrum is to develop a concise and concrete list of core research dependability recommendations that address problems of false positive and false negative findings in a noncontradicting manner. Examination of the current research dependability literature and earlier literatures dealing with the problem of false findings is used to arrive at a set of three core research dependability recommendations: (a) conduct and promote direct replication studies; (b) ensure data sharing when requested by fellow scientists; and (c) adopt and promote a truth seeking mindset during the research endeavor. A recent confluence of factors, including high-profile cases of research fraud by psychologists, questions regarding the depend-ability and replicability of scientific results, and concerns about the use of questionable research practices, has contributed to the emergence of a new movement to improve the scientific integrity of psychological science (Asendorpf et al., 2013; Funder et al., The primary goals of this movement, which I will refer to as the research dependability movement, are to illuminate problems in contempo-rary psychological science that undermine the integrity of empir-ical findings and to present potential solutions for how to address these problems. The movement appears to be gaining momentum as indicated by changes in the editorial policies of various prom-inent journals that appear designed to promote greater dependabil-ity in published findings (for several examples, see editorial pol-icies at Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Research in Personality, and Psychological Science). Increasing support for the movement has spawned numerous commentaries that seek to address the dependability problem (e.g., Ledgerwood, 2014a, 2014b, and accompanying special section articles; Makel, 2014, and accompanying special section articles; Pashler \& Wangenmakers, 2012, and accompanying special section articles; Spellman, 2012, and accompanying special section articles). Although several attempts to integrate solutions into comprehensive lists have been attempted (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013; Cumming, 2014; Funder et al., 2014), the number of proposed solutions and recommendations is growing quite large. A sampling of such recommendations based on a casual reading of various research dependability commentaries is provided in Table 1. Unfortunately, this glut of recommendations for improving re-search dependability has created several problems. First, the high number of recommendations is overwhelming for those hoping to implement meaningful changes in their own research activities or training programs. Second, the high number of recommendations makes it challenging to coordinate meaningful responses within and across constituencies that make up psychological science (i.e., researchers, journal editors and reviewers, administrators of re-search support institutions, and educators). Together, these prob-lems are fairly obvious in their potential impact: too many recom-mendations make it difficult to address research dependability challenges in a manner that is uniform among individuals within and across different constituencies. However, a third less obvious problem exists with the numerous research dependability recommendations. Specifically, many are based on concerns that arise from two earlier movements in psychological methodology and statistics that rest on somewhat contradictory assumptions. When these recommendations are un-critically blended under the research dependability umbrella, they may promote conflicting behaviors that undermine the very goals the dependability movement seeks to achieve. Given these problems, the purpose of the present commentary is to arrive at a concise list of core recommendations to improve the integrity of psychological science. This process was based on three guiding principles. First, and most importantly, core recommen-dations should be internally consistent in that they should lead to nonconflicting outcomes in addressing research dependability is-sues. Second, the number of recommendations should be small and},

In the first field setting, I allow consumers of all age and education levels to participate in one-shot and multiple-shot public goods games in a well-functioning marketplace. The second field study, an actual university capital campaign, gathers data from mail solicitations sent to 2,000 Central Florida residents. In the third field experiment, I examine data from an uncontrolled environment, a television gameshow, which closely resembles the classic prisoners dilemma game. Several insights emerge; perhaps the most provocative is that age and social preferences appear linked.},

We find that the labor market opportunities and family ties of both partners affect these location choices. Surprisingly, married men live significantly closer to their own parents than do married women, even if they have children, and this difference cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. The principal source of excess female distance from parents in this population is the relatively low mobility of men without a college degree, particularly in rural areas. Despite evidence that intergenerational resource flows, such as childcare and eldercare, are particularly important between women and their parents, the family connections of husbands appear to dominate the location decisions of less-educated married couples.

Results indicate that peer rejection at Time 1 predicted an increase in anxious and angry expectations of rejection at Time 2, but only for boys. Being liked by peers, irrespective of level of dislike, predicted a reduction in anxious rejection expectations in both boys and girls. Further, anxious expectations of rejection were uniquely predictive of increased social anxiety and withdrawal. Angry expectations of rejection, an established unique predictor of increased aggression, predicted decreased social anxiety. Both anxious and angry expectations predicted increased loneliness, but neither were unique predictors of loneliness. Implications of viewing anxious and angry expectations of rejection as distinct cognitive\textendash affective vulnerabilities for adolescents are discussed.},

We find, however, that the form of the pressure is an important determinant of the size of health contributions. Personal forms of solicitation appear to increase contributions, relative to impersonal forms such as media advertisements and mail campaigns. Within the class of personal solicitations, we find that pressure to give which is exerted by friends is more effective than requrests by strangers. Limited evidence was also found that some workplace relationships result in more effective fund-raising when compared to solicitations by strangers.},

  abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

Moreover, we targeted specific groups that were less likely to save and contribute to supplementary pensions, such as women and low-income employees.

While economists have studied aging extensively, the issue of aging has received less direct attention from the relatively younger field of behavioral economics. Nonetheless, many of the best-understood policies proposed by behavioral economics have implications for aging. In this paper, I review theoretical and empirical work in behavioral economics relevant to policies around global aging and highlight areas where more evidence is needed. I focus on interventions that encourage financial preparation for old age, policies that attempt to change health behaviors to mitigate the burden of non-communicable diseases and the implications of behavioral economics for policies that policies related to aging around health spending, insurance and regulation.},

Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

Medvec et al. argued that bronze medalists compared themselves to 4th place finishers, whereas silver medalists compared themselves to gold medalists. These counterfactuals were the most salient because they were either qualitatively different (gold vs. silver) or categorically different (medal vs. no medal) from what actually occurred. Drawing on archival data and experimental studies, we show that Olympic athletes (among others) are more likely to make counterfactual comparisons based on their prior expectations, consistent with decision affect theory. Silver medalists are more likely to be disappointed because their personal expectations are higher than those of bronze medalists. We provide a test between expectancy-based versus category-based processing and discuss circumstances that trigger each type of processing.},

  abstract = {We estimate the effect of a marginal personal solicitation after receiving two to four non-personal solicitations using observational data on alumni giving at an anonymous research university, which we refer to as Anon U. At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Development Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations. The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order. The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time before they reach the end of their lists. These observations suggest a simple strategy for testing whether personal solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the beginning, ceteris paribus. If so, then a marginal personal solicitation matters. Our main finding is that the location in the alphabet - and hence, a marginal personal solicitation - has a strong effect on the probability of making a gift. A rough estimate of the elasticity of the probability of giving with respect to the probability of receiving a personal solicitation is 0.15. However, there is no statistically discernible effect on the amount given, conditional on donating. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Using detailed data from Donorschoose.org, an online platform linking teachers with prospective donors, I examine the extent to which matching grants for donations to certain requests affect giving to others. Eligibility for matches is determined in entirely by observable attributes of the request, providing an exogenous source of variation in incentives to donate between charities. I find that, while matches increase giving to eligible requests, they do not appear to crowd out giving to similar ones, either contemporaneously or over time.},

  abstract = {Examined emotional experiences associated with the outcomes of risky options represented as gambles with monetary consequences. In Exp 1 with 67 undergraduates (aged 18\textendash 26 yrs), 25 gambles were presented to Ss: In Exp 2, with 47 undergraduates (aged 18\textendash 27 yrs), were presented 45 gambles to Ss. Results from the 2 experiments show that the emotional reaction to a monetary outcome is not a simple function of the utility of that outcome. Emotional responses also depend on probabilities and unobtained outcomes. Unexpected outcomes have greater emotional impact than expected outcomes. Furthermore, any given outcome is less pleasant if an unobtained outcome is better. The authors propose an account of emotional experiences associated with outcomes of decisions called decision affect theory. Decision affect theory incorporates utilities, expectations, and counterfactual comparisons into hedonic responses. Finally, the authors show that choices between risky options can be described as the maximization of expected emotional experiences, as predicted by decision affect theory.

  abstract = {The problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free to overuse-the 'tragedy of the commons'-emerges in many social dilemmas, such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods experiments, which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity, 'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists. Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.}

The ascendancy of the human capital approach can be viewed as a reaction of economists to this non-economic, though certainly not irrelevant, tradition. In stressing the role played by individual and family optimizing decisions in human capital investments, important aspects of income determination are brought back within the mainstream of economic theory and within the power of its analytical and econometric tools. Human capital is not the only element of choice in the analysis of income distribution . Nevertheless, it appears that the subject of human capital investments lends itself to a more systematic and comprehensive analysis of wage differentials, than each of the other factors. The following is a description of research in the distribution of labor incomes in which human capital theory serves as an organizing principle. It is, in part, a sequel to my 1970 survey and, in part, a report of ongoing research of my own and of others.},

According to Mollenhorst and colleagues, neighbours became more important in Dutch personal networks between 2000 and 2007. I assess how this developed between 2007-2008 and 2013. Next-door neighbours have (again) become more important. Neighbours are predominantly mentioned as associates who are visited and, increasingly, as associates who are asked for practical help. In contrast to Mollenhorst and colleagues, I find that the extent to which the Dutch like and trust neighbours in their network increased while contact frequency (further) declined. For highly educated residents, people without paid work, homeowners, and people with initially small local networks, the size of neighbour networks increased.},

The empirical section uses qualitative data estimation techniques which permit a wide range of joint and interaction effects among the variables of the model. The results confirm the importance of time-opportunity cost variables as major determinants of household's choice of activities with the mother's education constituting a particularly important factor.}

In the presence of social learning, we should see different box-office sales dynamics depending on whether opening weekend demand is higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature of the movie industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the number of screens dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week 1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality, further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting for 32\% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This implies the existence of a large ``social multiplier'' such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand.sss}

I use a unique feature of the movie industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the number of screens dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week 1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality, further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting for 32\% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This implies the existence of a large ``social multiplier'' such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand.sss}

Abstract In 2005, a drastic reform in the Israeli capital market shifted the power to choose savings vehicles from employers to individuals. Using a unique dataset from a large employer, this event provides us a rare window into individuals' savings decisions and the effect of their social environment. In the first year following the reform's implementation, 7\% of the employees switched out of the fund in which they all previously saved. Choice of fund was not associated with observable measures of fund performance, but was strongly affected by the employees' social environment. Exploiting within-department variation in peer groups, we find that savings decisions were strongly influenced by the choices of co-workers from the same ethnic group. Interviews also point to the influence of non-professional colleagues.}

I find that participants underestimate their percentile rank in the global income distribution by 27 points on average and overestimate the global median income by a factor of 10. Respondents who were randomly assigned to information on the global income distribution supported higher spending on foreign aid and cuts in agricultural trade protections at larger rates. A behavioral measure validates these survey data\textemdash donations to charities abroad rise by 55\% relative to the control group. These findings contribute to our understanding of subjective perceptions, preferences for cross-border redistribution, and the conditions under which information can shape opinion and behavior.},

Examining a dozen previously studied markets suggests that markets in which transactions are made far in advance are markets in which it is acceptable for firms to make exploding offers, and unacceptable for workers to renege on commitments they make, however early. But this evidence is only suggestive, because the markets differ in many ways other than norms concerning offers. Laboratory experiments allow us to isolate the effects of exploding offers and binding acceptances. In a simple environment, in which uncertainty about applicants' quality is resolved over time, we find inefficient early contracting when firms can make exploding offers and applicants' acceptances are binding. Relaxing either of these two conditions causes matching to take place later, when more information about applicants' qualities is available, and consequently results in higher efficiency and fewer blocking pairs. This suggests that elements of market culture may play an important role in influencing market performance.}

Most subjects simultaneously gave to multiple charities with similar missions even when the social benefit of gifts to different charities were not equal, as proxied by the matching rates applied to subjects' gifts. Taking each subject's preferences over the set of charities as given, these choices resulted in substantial inefficiencies: subjects forfeited social surplus (matching funds) equal to 25\% of the value of their gifts. Suggestive evidence indicates that warm glow utility derived from the act of making a gift, which can lead to a love of variety even among similar charities, and risk aversion over the social value of charitable gifts are both important factors motivating donors who make socially inefficient gifts. Additionally, few subjects were willing to pay for information that could have enabled them to increase the social benefit of their gifts, although many of these subjects also forfeited potential personal gains in an investment decision, casting some doubt on this interpretation. The possibility that the personal value of information might not be equal to the social value might help explain why there are so few rigorous evaluations of aid programs: such evaluations are costly to charities and might not be valued by donors. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Perhaps surprisingly, we found that piracy contributed to the decline in music sales but was not the main cause. In this article, we review and respond to recent criticism of our work by Stan Liebowitz in Econ Journal Watch. We show how the use of proxies for file sharing can result in misleading conclusions. We close by reviewing what we know about the impact of file sharing on record sales today. In our view, new music formats are an important if understudied channel through which changes in technology influence the demand for entertainment.}

However, evaluation is necessary to prove the effectiveness of the education especially for vulnerable consumer groups. If evaluation reveals that these groups cannot be targeted effectively or that consumers are not taking action subsequently to attending financial education, there might be a case for changing behaviour through the institutional set-up of pension schemes (i.e., through automatic enrollment) and using financial education as a supportive policy instrument.},

The case studies show that financial education with regard to old-age provision can be successful if it reaches consumers in their environment at life-stages where important decisions need to be made. To achieve that considerable efforts have to be taken in terms of funding and organizational set-up. However, evaluation is necessary to prove the effectiveness of the education especially for vulnerable consumer groups. If evaluation reveals that these groups cannot be targeted effectively or that consumers are not taking action subsequently to attending financial education, there might be a case for changing behaviour through the institutional set-up of pension schemes (i.e., through automatic enrollment) and using financial education as a supportive policy instrument.},

DiNapoli. The bonus estimate includes cash bonuses for the current year, supplemented by compensation deferred from prior years. ``Wall Street navigated through some rough patches last year and had a profitable year in 2013. Securities industry employees took home significantly higher bonuses on average,'' DiNapoli said. ``Although profits were lower than the prior year, the industry still had a good year in 2013 despite costly legal settlements and higher interest rates.

The covariance regression model results indicate lack of statistically significant difference between gift-giving women and men. However, the School of Business graduates, alumni who proceeded to obtain graduate degrees from this university, and alumni members of non-Greek social organizations gave significantly more. Moreover, alumni contributions varied systematically over the business cycle and a 1962 Federal Court Order to desegregate the university racially reduced donations but not significantly. Given the 63-year cycle studied, the growth rates of alumni donations of money are projected to decline after roughly age 52, which falls short of the typical retirement age.},

Graduate degree alumni have decreasing giving profiles for many years following completion of their first graduate degree but this decrease bottoms out later in life. It continues seven more years for alumni who earned a second graduate degree at the university. The "wealth-accumulation" effect of giving tends to dominate the "earnings-effect." Doctoral degree alumni have the highest giving profile among graduate school alumni. Racial desegregation of the university is positively and strongly related to alumni giving. Inferences of the giving profile of undergraduate degree alumni reported in past work do not extend to graduate school alumni.},

We approached about 4500 households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute.},

We find that on average the proposer offers 40\% of the pie to the responder. This share is smaller for larger pie sizes and larger when a strategy method is used or when subjects are inexperienced. On average 16\% of the offers is rejected. The rejection rate is lower for larger pie sizes and for larger shares offered. Responders are less willing to accept an offer when the strategy method is employed. As the results come from different countries, meta-analysis provides an alternative way to investigate whether bargaining behavior in ultimatum games differs across countries. We find differences in behavior of responders (and not of proposers) across geographical regions. With one exception, these differences cannot be attributed to various cultural traits on which for instance the cultural classifications of Hofstede (1991) and Inglehart (2000) are based.},

The results show that consumers'' ethical beliefs are determined, in part, by who is at fault in the unethical behavior (the seller or the buyer). The results also indicate that those with a more positive attitude toward business are less likely to engage in questionable consumer practices, but one''s attitudes toward salespeople, the government and people in general arenot related to the consumer''s ethical beliefs.}

  abstract = {The Paleolithic diet, Paleo diet, caveman diet, or stone-age diet is a modern fad diet consisting of foods thought by its proponents to mirror those eaten during the Paleolithic era.There are different variants of the diet; some are predominantly plant-based but the most recent popular variants focus on animal products. The diet avoids processed food and typically includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, roots, and meat and excludes dairy products, grains, sugar, legumes, processed oils, salt, alcohol, and coffee. The ideas behind the diet can be traced to primitive diets advocated in 19th century. In the 1970s Walter L. Voegtlin popularized a meat-centric "Stone Age" diet, and in the 21st century, the Paleo Diet was popularized in the best-selling books of Loren Cordain. As of 2019 the paleo diet industry was worth approximately US\$500 million. In the 21st century, the sequencing of the human genome and DNA analysis of the remains of early humans has found evidence that humans evolved rapidly in response to changing diet. This evidence undermines a core premise of the paleolithic diet, that human digestion has remained essentially unchanged over time. Anthropological science has found that the paleolithic human diet was more varied and less meat-centric than had been assumed. The paleolithic diet is promoted as a way of improving health. There is some evidence that following it may lead to improvements in body composition and metabolism compared with the typical Western diet or compared with diets recommended by some European nutritional guidelines. On the other hand, following the diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies such as an inadequate calcium intake, and side effects can include weakness, diarrhea, and headaches.},

  abstract = {This study designs two field experiments to estimate the effect of binding deadlines and reminders on charitable giving. We sent out 62,000 e-mails and text messages to prior donors of a large Danish charity while varying the length of the deadline and whether they received a reminder. We find that a reminder increases both the likelihood of making a donation and the amount donated. We find no effect of the deadlines on the propensity to give. Instead we observe a " now-or-never " effect; either donations are made immediately or not at all. In line with the " avoiding-the-ask " theory, both shorter deadlines and the reminder increase the number of requests to be taken off the mailing list.},

Using a nationally representative US sample, the present study examined whether perceived likelihood of developing cancer and worry about cancer were associated with reports of avoiding visits to one's doctor, in respondents under and over age 50. Cancer worry, but not perceived risk of cancer, predicted doctor avoidance in respondents aged 50 and older, whereas the opposite pattern held for respondents under age 50. Moreover, in respondents aged 50 and older, cancer worry and perceived cancer risk interacted such that cancer worry was linked to doctor avoidance only when respondents also perceived a high likelihood of cancer. The latter result is consistent with the notion that worry may motivate information seeking when people expect information to dispel worry and information avoidance when the information is seen as highly likely to confirm one's fears. Findings suggest a need for communication strategies that can influence worry and perceived risk differentially. Research should also assess the effectiveness of other behavioral strategies (e.g., automatic scheduling of appointments) as a means for reducing doctor avoidance.},

  title = {The Impact of Population Aging on Financial Markets},
  author = {Poterba, James},
  year = {2004},
  institution = {{National Bureau of Economic Research}},
  abstract = {A number of financial market analysts have argued that the aging of the "Baby Boom" cohort contributed to the rise U.S. asset values during the 1990s, and that asset prices will decline when this group reaches retirement age and begins to draw down its wealth. This paper explores the importance of changing demographic structure for asset returns, asset prices, and the composition of household balance sheets in the United States. Standard models suggest that equilibrium returns on financial assets will vary in response to changes in population age structure. While the direction of the effect of demographic changes is not controversial, the quantitative importance of such changes for financial markets is open to debate. The paper presents several strands of empirical evidence that bear on this issue. First, it describes current age-specific patterns of asset holding in the United States, and finds that asset holdings rise sharply when households are in their 30s and 40s. Aside from the automatic decline in the value of defined benefit pension assets as households age, however, other financial assets decline only gradually during retirement. When these data are used to project asset demands in light of the future age structure of the U.S. population, they do not show a sharp decline in asset demand between 2020 and 2050. This finding calls into question the "asset market meltdown" view. Second, the paper considers the historical association between population age structure and real returns on Treasury bills, long-term government bonds, and corporate stock. The evidence suggests only modest effects, if any, of a changing demographic mix. Statistical tests based on the few effective degrees of freedom in the historical record of age structure and asset returns have limited power to detect such effects. There is a stronger historical correlation between asset levels, as measured for example by the price-dividend ratio, and summary measures of the population age structure. Once again, however, the results are sensitive to choices about econometric specification. These empirical findings provide modest support, at best, for the view that asset prices could decline as the share of households over the age of 65 increases.},

Potential explanations are that these announcements cause future donors to increase their contributions, either because they want to reciprocate the generosity of earlier donors, or because the initial contributions are seen as a signal of the charity's quality. Using experimental methods we investigate these two hypotheses. When only the first donor is informed of the public good's quality, subjects not only copy the initial contribu- tion, but the first donor also correctly anticipates this response. While this result is consistent with both the signaling and the reciprocity explanations, the latter is unlikely to be the driving force. The reason is that announcements have no effect on contribution levels when the quality of the public good is common knowledge. Thus our results provide strong support for the signaling hypothesis.

Outcomes from meta-analyses provide a more objective and transparent summary of a research area than traditional narrative reviews. Moreover, they are often used to support research grant applications, guide clinical practice and direct health policy. The aim of this article is to provide a practical and nontechnical guide for psychological scientists that outlines the steps involved in planning and performing a meta-analysis of correlational datasets. I provide a supplementary R script to demonstrate each analytical step described in the paper, which is readily adaptable for researchers to use for their analyses. While the worked example is the analysis of correlational dataset, the general meta-analytic process described in this paper is applicable for all types of effect sizes. I also emphasise the importance of meta-analysis protocols and pre-registration to improve transparency and help avoid unintended duplication. An improved understanding this tool will not only help scientists to conduct their own meta-analyses but also improve their evaluation of published meta-analyses.},

Our main result is that the mobility of young adults crucially depends on the presence of a sibling. Siblings compete in location and employment decisions to direct parental care decisions towards their preferred outcome. Only children are not exposed to this kind of competition. This causes an equilibrium in which siblings exhibit higher mobility than only children, and also have better labour market outcomes. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we find evidence that confirms these patterns.},

This framework illuminates how material and ideological relations are negotiated across production and consumption arenas. In the case of Fair Trade, progressive ideas and practices related to trust, equality, and global responsibility are intertwined with traditional commercial and industrial conventions. As I demonstrate, the negotiation of these divergent conventions shortens the social distance between Fair Trade coffee consumers and producers. I conclude that by re\textendash linking consumers and producers, commodity network analysis provides a robust entr\'e for academic inquiry and engagement in alternative food politics.},

A non-contributor feels disapproval, whereas a contributor feels approval if he believes that a contributor observes his type. The game has two asymptotically stable states: one in which everybody is a contributor, and one in which nobody is a contributor. Governmental subsidization of the public good can move the society to the former state, whereas a governmental contribution to the public good can move the society to the latter. Indeed, this crowding in or crowding out prevails even after policy reversal.},

  abstract = {A randomized experiment with almost 35 million Pandora listeners enables us to measure the sensi-tivity of consumers to advertising, also known as the demand curve for Pandora ad-supported listening. The experiment randomized listeners into nine treatment groups, each of which received a different level of audio advertising interrupting their music listening, with the highest treatment group receiving more than twice as many ads as the lowest treatment group. By keeping consistent treatment assignment for 21 months, we can see that the long-term effects of a change in " ad load, " or number of ads per hour, take over a year to be fully realized. We estimate a demand curve that is strikingly linear, with the number of hours listened decreasing linearly in the number of ads per hour. We also show the negative impact on the number of days listened and on the probability of listening at all in the final month. Using an experimental design that separately varies the number of commercial interruptions per hour and the number of ads per commercial interruption, we find that neither makes any difference to listeners except for the way they increase the total number of ads per hour. Lastly, we find increased ad load causes a significant increase in the number of paid ad-free subscriptions to Pandora, particularly among older listeners.}

  abstract = {Consumers have shown a willingness to pay a premium for products labeled as ``FT'' and a preference for retailers that are seen to be more generous to their suppliers/employees. A FT product is essentially a bundle of a base product and a donation to the supplier (e.g., a coffee farmer). An altruistic rational consumer will only choose this bundle if doing so is less expensive than buying the base product and making a direct donation. For FT to be sustainable either in a competitive equilibrium or in a monopolistic environment this bundling must yield an efficiency. This efficiency is generated in the following context. A supplier's investment reduces the retailer's cost or boosts the final product's quality, but this investment is not immediately observable and cannot be enforced, hence there exists a moral hazard problem. In this environment, the altruism of the consumer can facilitate a more efficient contract: by paying the supplier more the retailer can both extract more consumer surplus and increase the level of contracted investment, while preserving the supplier's incentive compatibility constraint. We assess our model in the context of the coffee industry.}

  abstract = {Previous experimental and observational work suggests that people act more generously when they are observed and observe others in social settings. However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own reputation. Alternately (or additionally) she may value the public good or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, "leader" subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously or with their identities, and these were reported either before these "follower" subjects made their donation decisions. We find that "leaders" are influential only when their identities are revealed along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for "reputation-seeking."},

However, with more general utility functions that include additional effects such as warm-glow or snob appeal, the charity may benefit from announcing contributions.},

In the context of ordinary significance-testing analysis, optional stopping is discouraged, because it necessarily leads to increased type I error rates over nominal values. This article addresses whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian inference with Bayes factors. Statisticians who developed Bayesian methods thought not, but this wisdom has been challenged by recent simulation results of Yu, Sprenger, Thomas, and Dougherty (2013) and Sanborn and Hills (2013). In this article, I show through simulation that the interpretation of Bayesian quantities does not depend on the stopping rule. Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ optional stopping in their own research and may provide Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed stopping rule. I emphasize here the proper interpretation of Bayesian quantities as measures of subjective belief on theoretical positions, the difference between frequentist and Bayesian interpretations, and the difficulty of using frequentist intuition to conceptualize the Bayesian approach.},

The three income allocation rules are designed to capture preferences for distributive justice among subjects. The concern is motivated by claims in some of the experimental economics literature that non-self-interested motives often underlie individual behavior. We cannot reject self-interest in favor of any redistribution motives based on our observations. Almost all individuals chose the income distribution which maximized their own income ,\"A\^i high income individuals chose no redistribution and low income individuals chose perfect equality in income distribution.},

When this is not the case, commodity taxation is a tool that allows the government to expand its taxation power and is therefore desirable. This can happen either when the government uses social weights correlated with consumption patterns even conditioning on income or when patterns of consumption are related to intrinsic earning power or leisure choices. In that latter case, the desirability of commodity taxation hinges not on whether the commodity is consumed disproportionately by high earners but rather on whether individual demand for that good is less elastic than the cross-sectional demand pattern. ...},

This may transform a disappointing dataset into a publishable study, but it does so at the cost of increasing the Type I error rate. How big of a problem is this, and what can we do about it? To answer the first question, we estimate the Type I error inflation based on the initial sample size, the number of participants used to augment the dataset, the critical value for determining significance (typically .05), and the maximum p value within the initial sample such that the dataset would be augmented. With one round of augmentation, Type I error inflation maximizes at .0975 with typical values from .0564 to .0883. To answer the second question, we review methods of adjusting the critical value to allow augmentation while maintaining p \textbackslash textless .05, but we note that such methods must be applied a priori. For the common occurrence of post-hoc dataset augmentation, we develop a new statistic, paugmented , that represents the magnitude of the resulting Type I error inflation. We argue that the disclosure of post-hoc dataset augmentation via paugmented elevates such augmentation from a questionable research practice to an ethical research decision.},

However, solid-state devices based on single- A nd bilayer WSe2 typically exhibit unipolar transport and poor electrical performance when conventional SiO2 dielectric and Au electrodes are used. Here, we show that silane-containing functional molecules form ordered monolayers on the top of the WSe2 surface, thereby boosting its electrical performance in single- A nd bilayer field-effect transistors. In particular, by employing SiO2 dielectric substrates and top Au electrodes, we measure unipolar mobility as high as {$\mu$}h = 150 cm2 V-1 s-1 and {$\mu$}e = 17.9 cm2 V-1 s-1 in WSe2 single-layer devices when ad hoc molecular monolayers are chosen. Additionally, by asymmetric double-side functionalization with two different molecules, we provide opposite polarity to the top and bottom layer of bilayer WSe2, demonstrating nearly balanced ambipolarity at the bilayer limit. Our results indicate that the controlled functionalization of the two sides of the WSe2 mono- A nd bilayer flakes with highly ordered molecular monolayers offers the possibility to simultaneously achieve energy level engineering and defect functionalization, representing a path toward deterministic control over charge transport in 2D materials.},

  abstract = {Now available in paperback. This book provides a comprehensive account of survey sampling theory and methodology which will be suitable for students and researchers across a variety of disciplines. A central theme is to show how statistical modeling is a vital component of the sampling process and in the choice of estimation technique. Statistical modeling has strongly influenced sampling theory in recent years and has clarified many issues related to the uses of auxiliary information in surveys. This is the first textbook that systematically extends traditional sampling theory with the aid of a modern model assisted outlook. The central ideas of sampling theory are developed from the unifying perspective of unequal probability sampling. The book covers classical topics as well as areas where significant new developments have taken place notably domain estimation, variance estimation, methods for handling nonresponse, models for measurement error, and the analysis of survey data. The authors have taken care to presuppose nothing more on the part of the reader than a first course in statistical inference and regression analysis. Throughout, the emphasis is on statistical ideas rather than advanced mathematics. Each chapter concludes with a range of exercises incorporating the analysis of data from actual finite populations. As a result, all those concerned with survey methodology or engaged in survey sampling will find this an invaluable and up-to-date coverage of the subject.},

  abstract = {Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991). Information is sold under a large variety of forms: industry reports, consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial, and legal professionals, among others. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study competition in the rapidly emerging information sector. Specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Is competition fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather than traditional goods and services, and-if yes-why? (2) What are the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers and regulators)? (3) Can we explain some of the observed marketing strategies in the information industry? As such, the audience of the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested in understanding what is specific about competition in information markets. Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential for those who are faced with the problem of marketing information. To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic model that consists of two firms selling information to a population of consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for the quality of information. The most important features of the model are the following. Information products sold by the two firms are modeled as random draws from two normal distributions having equal mean. The variances of these distributions and their correlatedness constitute the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common knowledge. Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more accurate estimate. Quality of information is linked to the accuracy of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by the accuracy of each sample as well as by their correlatedness. Consumers' utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on their inherent utility for quality (taste), and on the total price they paid to acquire information. Knowing consumer preferences, firms simultaneously price their information products. The main finding of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive structures. In particular, the qualitative nature of competition changes depending on basic product characteristics. While traditional products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or the other, depending on its position within the same product-attribute space. Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively with a continuous change in basic product-attribute levels. The intuition behind this finding is the following. When purchasing information, consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase from several information sellers. This is more likely to happen when the reliability of information is low and the sources of information are independent. Under such conditions information products tend to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is relatively mild. In the opposite case, when information is reliable and/or sellers' sources are highly correlated, consumers are satisfied after consulting a single source. In this case, information products are substitutes and sellers tend to undercut one another's prices to induce consumers to choose their brand. Understanding this discontinuity in competitive structures has important implications for decision makers as very different strategies are optimal under different product characteristics. Under substitution, traditional strategies to avoid competition (e.g., differentiation) are recommended. When the competing products' reliability is generally low (they are complements) firms are better off accommodating competition. In fact, we find that a firm may benefit from "inviting" a competitor. Finally, our findings are also important for regulators of information markets. As the literature on complementarity suggests, price fixing agreements between firms offering complementary products may benefit firms as well as consumers.},

Do people have a need to satisfy their demand for giving by contributing to a particular charity? Or can the demand for doing good be satisfied by giving to any organization? In a donation dictator game competition between charities is simulated by altering the set of similar real charities to which subjects can give. I find weak substitution between charities when giving to more than one charity is possible, as the donated amounts to individual charities decrease with the size of the choice set. At the same time, the sum of donations to all charities increases when charities are in competition. Additionally, a reduced price in giving to one charity (matching grant) increases giving to the matched charity. However, a match does not result in a complete shift of donations to this charity. Further, subjects substitute part of their own contributions with the matching grant and leave their individual total contributions unchanged.},

Our standard for assessing optimality comes from a life-cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefit functions derived from rich household data. We solve every household's decision problem from death to starting age and then use the decision rules in conjunction with earnings histories to make predictions about wealth in 1992. Ours is the first study to compare, household by household, wealth predictions that arise from a life-cycle model that incorporates earnings histories for a nationally representative sample. The results, based on data from the Health and Retirement Study, are striking we find that the model is capable of accounting for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research indicates that certain personality traits relate to performance in the medical profession. Yet, personality testing during selection seems ineffective. In this study, we examine the extent to which different medical school selection processes call upon desirable personality characteristics in applicants.: 1019 of all 1055 students who entered the Dutch Bachelor of Medicine at University of Groningen, the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were included in this study. Students were admitted based on either top pre-university grades (n = 139), acceptance in a voluntary multifaceted selection process (n = 286), or lottery weighted for pre-university GPA. Within the lottery group, we distinguished between students who had not participated (n = 284) and students who were initially rejected (n = 310) in the voluntary selection process. Two months after admission, personality was assessed with the NEO-FFI, a measure of the five factor model of personality. We performed ANCOVA modelling with gender as a covariate to examine personality differences between the four groups.: The multifaceted selection group scored higher on extraversion than all other groups(p0.01), higher on conscientiousness than both lottery-admitted groups(p0.01), and lower on neuroticism than the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in the voluntary selection process. The latter group scored lower on conscientiousness than all other groups(p0.05) and lower on agreeableness than the multifaceted selection group and the top pre-university group(p0.01).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Differences between the four admission groups, though statistically significant, were relatively small. Personality scores in the group admitted through the voluntary multifaceted selection process seemed most fit for the medical profession. Personality scores in the lottery-admitted group that had not participated in this process seemed least fit for the medical profession. It seems that in order to select applicants with suitable personalities, an admission process that calls upon desirable personality characteristics is beneficial.},

More specifically, the following research question is answered: To what extent are labour market outcomes of physicians explained by the skills acquired in education, as indicated in the theory of human capital, or by competences already present at the start of education, as suggested by the screening theory? The study uses separate measurements of competence at the start and at the end of education. Moreover, we use a direct measurement of competence development during medical education. This enables us to disentangle the effects of the suggested mechanisms. The results suggest that after graduation human capital factors do not explain subsequent differences in labour market outcomes. The medical degree seems a sufficient signal of screening device as such. However, selection processes during education take place on human capital acquired before and during medical education.}

The reason, that reservation values were unobtainable, may no longer be true now that massive datasets tracking detailed individual behavior exist. Hence, a fundamental change in the way goods are priced may be underway. I investigate this claim in one context. I show demographics, which in the past could be used to personalize prices, poorly predict which consumers subscribe to Netflix. By contrast, modern web- browsing data, with variables such as visits to Amazon.com and internet use on Tuesdays - variables which reflect behavior - do substantially better. I then present a model to estimate demand and simulate outcomes had 1st degree PD been implemented. The model is structural, derived from canonical theory models, but resembles an ordered Probit, allowing a new method for handling massive datasets and addressing overfitting and high dimensionality. Simulations show using demographics alone to tailor prices raises profits by 0.8\%. Including nearly 5000 potential website browsing explanatory variables increases profits by much more, 12.2\%, increasingly the appeal of tailored pricing, and resulting in some consumers paying double the price others do for the exact same product. Implications for the overall economy and its structure are discussed. (JEL: D42, L130)},

Policy decisions, in turn, affect asset values, hence forward looking traders may have incentives to withhold information. I derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of fully revealing equilibria in competitive financial markets, which identifies all situations where learning from prices for policy purposes works, and where it does not. Full revelation may be impossible because the pricing problem is a self-defeating prophecy. Using the result, I demonstrate that some corporate prediction markets are ill-designed and punish traders for revealing their information, and show how to fix it. I also discuss the possibility of using market information for banking supervision and central banking, and the general problem of asset design.},

The second hypothesis, extremeness aversion, states that the attractiveness of an option is enhanced if it is an intermediate option in the choice set and is diminished if it is an extreme option. These hypotheses can explain previous findings (e.g., attraction and compromise effects) and predict some new effects, demonstrated in a series of studies with consumer products as choice alternatives.

  abstract = {Abstract: A persistent puzzle in the social and biological sciences is the existence of prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others, often at a cost to oneself. Recent theoretical models and empirical studies of indirect reciprocity show that actors behave prosocially in order to develop an altruistic reputation and receive future benefits from third parties. Accordingly, individuals should stop investing in reputations via prosocial behavior when a future benefit (via indirect reciprocity) is unlikely. The conclusion that the absence of reputational incentives necessarily leads to egoistic behavior contrasts sharply with models of heterogeneous social preferences. Such models demonstrate the theoretical plausibility of populations composed of egoists and altruists. Results of Study One show that actors classified a priori as egoists respond strategically to reputational incentives, whereas those classified a priori as altruists are less affected by these incentives. Egoists act prosocially when reputational incentives are at stake but not when opportunities for indirect reciprocity are absent, while altruists tend to act prosocially regardless of whether reputational incentives are present. These results suggest that altruistic behavior can result from non-strategic altruism or reputation-building egoism. Study Two replicates these results and explores indirect reciprocation of others' prosocial acts. We found that altruists indirectly reciprocate at higher levels than egoists, and individuals tend to discount others' prosocial behaviors when they occur in the presence of reputational incentives. As a result, public prosocial behaviors are indirectly reciprocated less than private prosocial behaviors. In line with our argument that altruists pay less attention to reputational incentives, egoists showed a greater tendency than altruists to discount others' public prosocial behaviors. The results support the growing focus on heterogeneity of individuals' social preferences in models of altruism and indirect reciprocity},

  abstract = {Most people are caring and will exert great effort to rescue individual victims whose needy plight comes to their attention. These same good people, however, often become numbly indifferent to the plight of individuals who are ``one of many'' in a much greater problem. Why does this occur? The answer to this question will help us answer a related question that is the topic of this paper: Why, over the past century, have good people repeatedly ignored mass murder and genocide? Every episode of mass murder is unique and raises unique obstacles to intervention. But the repetitiveness of such atrocities, ignored by powerful people and nations, and by the general public, calls for explanations that may reflect some fundamental deficiency in our humanity \textemdash{} a deficiency that, once identified, might possibly be overcome. One fundamental mechanism that may play a role in many, if not all, episodes of mass-murder neglect involves the capacity to experience affect, the positive and negative feelings that combine with reasoned analysis to guide our judgments, decisions, and actions. I shall draw from psychological research to show how the statistics of mass murder or genocide, no matter how large the numbers, fail to convey the true meaning of such atrocities. The reported numbers of deaths represent dry statistics, ``human beings with the tears dried off,'' that fail to spark emotion or feeling and thus fail to motivate action. Recognizing that we cannot rely only upon our moral feelings to motivate proper action against genocide, we must look to moral argument and international law. The 1948 Genocide Convention was supposed to meet this need, but it has not been effective. It is time to examine this failure in light of the psychological deficiencies described here and design legal and institutional mechanisms that will enforce proper response to genocide and other forms of mass murder.},

As a result, I model contributions and beliefs using a system of simultaneous equations. Estimating the system provides evidence on the magnitude of the projection bias. Since contributions and beliefs move together, indicating that current and/or past values of one series are not useful for predicting future values of the other, I develop and test the hypothesis that contribution heterogeneity predicts changes in average contributions. I find support for my hypothesis using data from a variety of public good game experiments (with and without belief elicitation; fixed and random matching).},

For a period of 29 weeks, the means by which offerings are gathered is determined by chance, prescribing for each offering the use of either `closed\'collection bags or open collection baskets. When using baskets, attendants\'contributions can be identified by their direct neighbors, and attendants can observe the total amount given by the people who preceded them. Initially, contributions to the services\'second offerings increase by 10\% when baskets are used, whereas no effect is found for first offerings. The positive effect of using baskets peters out over the experimental period. Additional data on the coins collected show that in both offerings, people switch to giving larger coins when baskets are used.},

With regard to research directed instead at estimating causal effects, we discuss three distinct weighting motives: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity; (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling; and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does.},

We find significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group" and "reference dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. This can provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content.}

Based on this hypothesis, the present study empirically examines the effect of university location choice on earnings in Finland, focusing on the following question: To what extent does the choice of university location explain the observed positive early-career earnings premium for students graduating from the Helsinki metropolitan area rather than from one of the nine other university cities? The results suggest that no positive average earnings premium exists for metro area graduates after differences in students' pre-university characteristics are taken into account. However, the metro area university premium is found to be, to some extent, heterogeneous across fields and regional labour markets. The findings also indicate the importance of accounting for the selective nature of individuals' migration behaviour when conditioning on post-university region in the estimation of university location effects.},

Until the late 1980s, coffee growers and producing states retained over a third of the total income and about half of the total surplus that was available. This was due in part to the collective actions of coffee-producing states, which led to the imposition of a regulatory regime involving export quotas, creating rents for the producing countries. By the late 1980s, coffee TNCs had consolidated their control over core markets, and began to use their market power to increase their shares of both income and surplus. This shift was greatly accelerated by the breakdown of the export quota regime in 1989. The article concludes that these results necessitate a reformulation of commodity chain analysis.}

We propose a simple method for modeling interactions between the treatment and covariates. The idea is to modify the covariate in a simple way, and then fit a standard model using the modified covariates and no main effects. We show that coupled with an efficiency augmentation procedure, this method produces valid inferences in a variety of settings. It can be useful for personalized medicine: determining from a large set of biomarkers the subset of patients that can potentially benefit from a treatment. We apply the method to both simulated datasets and gene expression studies of cancer. The modified data can be used for other purposes, for example large scale hypothesis testing for determining which of a set of covariates interact with a treatment variable.},

We employ an experimental design with three treatments that vary the recipient (experimenter, charity) and amount passed (fixed, varying). We find giving to the experimenter not to be significantly different from giving to a charity, when the amount the subject donates crowds out the amount donated by the experimenter such that the charity always receives a fixed amount. This result suggests that the latter treatment, first used by Crumpler and Grossman (J Public Econ 92(5-6):1011-1021, 2008), does not provide a clean test of warm glow motivation. We then propose a new method of detecting warm glow motivation based on the idea that in a random-lottery incentive (RLI) scheme, such as the one we employ, warm glow accumulates and this may lead to satiation, whereas purely altruistic motivation does not. We also provide bounds on the magnitudes of warm glow and pure altruism as motives that drive giving in our experiment.},

Household consumptions comove with village average consumption. More clearly, household consumptions are not much influenced by contemporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment, or other idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (i.e. for village level risk). There is evidence that the landless are less well insured than their village neighbors in one of the three villages.}

  abstract = {Lipodystrophy is a common long-term complication of HIV infection that may lead to decreased quality of life and less adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). A complete understanding of the etiology of HIV-associated lipodystrophy has not as yet been achieved, although factors related to the virus, per se, and use of ART appear to be related. Alcohol use is common among HIV-infected patients and has biological effects on fat distribution, yet alcohol's relationship to HIV-associated lipodystrophy has not been examined. The goal of this clinical study was to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on lipodystrophy in HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems. This was a prospective study (2001 - 2006) of 289 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems. The primary outcome was self-reported lipodystrophy, which was assessed at one timepoint (median 29 months after enrollment). Alcohol use was assessed every 6 months and classified as: abstinent at all interviews; {$\geq$}1 report of moderate drinking but no heavy drinking; 1 or 2 reports of heavy drinking; or {$\geq$}3 reports of heavy drinking. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to the data. Fifty-two percent (150/289) of subjects reported lipodystrophy. Alcohol consumption was: 34\% abstinent at all interviews; 12\% {$\geq$}1 report of moderate drinking, but no heavy drinking; 34\% 1-2 reports of heavy drinking; 20\% {$\geq$}3 reports of heavy drinking. Although not statistically significant, subjects with alcohol use had a higher odds of lipodystrophy [adjusted odds ratios and 95\% CI: {$\geq$}1 report of moderate drinking, 2.36 (0.89, 6.24); 1-2 reports of heavy drinking, 1.34 (0.69, 2.60); {$\geq$}3 reports of heavy drinking, 2.07 (0.90, 4.73)]. Alcohol use may increase the odds of developing HIV-associated lipodystrophy among subjects with alcohol problems. However, larger studies are needed to elucidate fully the role and impact of alcohol consumption on the development of this common long-term complication of HIV infection and its treatment. For},

  abstract = {Most Americans who use the Internet have little idea how vulnerable they are to abuse by online and offline marketers and how the information they provide can be used to exploit them. That is one conclusion from this unprecedented national phone survey conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center. The study indicates that many adults who use the internet believe incorrectly that laws prevent online and offline stores from selling their personal information. They also incorrectly believe that stores cannot charge them different prices based on what they know about them. Most other internet-using adults admit that they simply don't know whether or not laws protect them. The survey further reveals that the majority of adults who use the internet do not know where to turn for help if their personal information is used illegally online or offline. The study's findings suggest a complex mix of ignorance and knowledge, fear and bravado, realism and idealism that leaves most internet-using adult American shoppers open to financial exploitation by retailers.},

The sad movies produced significantly lower donation rates than the neutral movies.

  abstract = {Medical Education 2011: 45: 1032-1040 Objectives A recent controlled study by our group showed that the dropout rate in the first 2 years of study of medical students selected for entry by the assessment of a combination of non-cognitive and cognitive abilities was 2.6 times lower than that of a control group of students admitted by lottery. The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of these two groups in the clinical phase. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed to compare the performance of 389 medical students admitted by selection with that of 938 students admitted by weighted lottery between 2001 and 2004. Follow-up of these cohorts lasted 5.5-8.5 years. The main outcome measures were the mean grade obtained on the first five discipline-specific clerkships by all cohorts and the mean grade achieved on all 10 clerkships by the cohorts of 2001 and 2002. Results Selected students obtained a significantly higher mean grade during their first five clerkships than lottery-admitted students (mean {$\pm$} standard error [SE] 7.95 {$\pm$} 0.03, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 7.90-8.00 versus mean {$\pm$} SE 7.84 {$\pm$} 0.02, 95\% CI 7.81-7.87; p 0.001). This difference reflected the fact that selected students achieved a grade of {$\geq$} 8.0 1.5 times more often than lottery-admitted students. An analysis of all mean grades awarded on 10 clerkships revealed the same results. Moreover, the longer follow-up period over the clerkships showed that the relative risk for dropout was twice as low in the selected student group as in the lottery-admitted student group. Conclusions The selected group received significantly higher mean grades on their first five clerkships, which could not be attributed to factors other than the selection procedure. Although the risk for dropout before the clinical phase increased somewhat in both groups, the actual dropout rate proved to be twice as low in the selected group.},

Failing to control for valid covariates can yield biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or in imperfectly randomized experiments and contributes to underpowered analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. We introduce double-lasso regression as a principle method for variable selection. The double lasso method is calibrated to not over-select potentially spurious covariates, and simulations demonstrate that using this method reduces error and increases statistical power. This method can be used to identify which covariates have sufficient empirical support for inclusion in analyses of correlations, moderation, mediation and experimental interventions, as well as to test for the effectiveness of randomization. We illustrate both the method's usefulness and how to implement it in practice by applying it to four analyses from the prior literature, using both correlational and experimental data.},

However, in all previous experiments, there have been no costs to inclusion or benefits for ostracism.

In 2 studies, the authors attempted to "load the dice" against inclusion in favor of ostracism. Participants played a variant of Cyberball called euroyberball (pronounced Euroball), in which ostracism and inclusion were crossed with whether the participants earned or lost money for each ball toss they received. In 2 experiments, the authors found that even when being ostracized meant retaining more money than the other players, it was painful. In Study 2, the authors also introduced conditions in which participants were overincluded. In these conditions, participants were sensitive to financial incentives. However, even then participants felt worse when given no positive attention than when given punitive attention.},

These questions are assessed among married workers using an identical survey distributed to Dutch and American workers in 2007. Despite marked differences in expected pension replacement rates - where the Dutch replacement rates are systematically higher than the American rates - the perceived savings adequacy is more or less the same across Dutch and American workers. In both countries, about half of the respondents were confident they had amassed sufficient retirement savings. Individuals' perceived savings adequacy was found to be influenced by three groups of factors : trust in pension institutions (pension funds, banks, insurance companies and governments), social forces and psychological dispositions. This study shows that differences in the dispositions of workers (with respect to future orientation and financial planning) played a far larger role in explaining differences in perceptions of savings adequacy in the United States than in The Netherlands. Dutch workers rely and trust their pension fund and seem to leave thinking about and planning for retirement to its managers. KEY},

The control treatment is a standard public bad experiment, while in the leader treatments the design is such that in each group the leader decides first on his or her investment in the public bad. After being informed about the leader's decision, the four ,\"A\`ofollowers' in each group make their investment decision. Two treatments of the leadership game are played with each group. In the same-leader-costs treatment, all subjects are confronted with the same costs, while in the no-leader-costs treatment the leader faces no direct costs of acting socially. It is found that followers invest significantly less in the public bad when there is a leader compared with a situation when there is no leader. Comparing the two treatments, we find, moreover, that the leadership effect is somewhat stronger when leaders face the same costs as followers compared with the situation in which leaders bear no costs. Randomly chosen leaders set an example by investing less than average players in a standard public bad game, and leader investments are lowest when the costs of leading are low.}

In this article, I investigate the implications of the existence of both conditional cooperators and egoists for optimal law enforcement strategies. When norms of cooperation exist between conditional cooperators, sanctions set by an authority can be lower than in a "Hobbesian" setting where everybody is egoistic. Moreover, if the authorities have private information about the fraction of egoists in society, low sanctions can be optimal because they signal that there are few defectors and thus "crowd in" trust and cooperation between agents. In social dilemmas where conditional cooperation is an important factor, as is the case in tax compliance, the model provides a rationale for the low observed sanctions in the real world and the mixed evidence on the effectiveness of deterrence. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Author.

We find that the presence of a large labour market is the most important structural economic determinant for these higher retention rates. Cyclical determinants appear to affect university graduate migration more than college graduate migration.},

  abstract = {Individuals who are concerned for a nonprofit's mission benefit from activities that increase the nonprofit's output. As these benefits are enjoyed by anyone with similar concerns, donations are both nonrival and nonexclusive, and they can be modeled as voluntary contributions to public goods. Noting the inherent free-rider problem, much theoretical and applied research has been done to understand how voluntary provision of public goods nonetheless is secured and how it can be improved. The objective of this chapter is to review the literature that uses experimental methods to shed light on voluntary giving.}

The optimal search is analyzed for one sector, as well as across several independent labor-market segments. It is shown that there are reasonably general conditions on the search environments, for which both the individual reservation wage and escape rate are negative-duration dependent, a fact observed in empirical studies}

Our sample draws from nine fishing communities in South-Africa where high levels of inequality prevail. We find that aggregate cooperation is higher in both the voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM) and punishment treatments for unequal groups. Once peer sanctioning is introduced over-contribution by low relative to high endowment players observed in the VCM treatment is significantly enhanced. Demand for punishment by low and high endowment players are similar, irrespective of differences in relative costs, and in unequal groups free-riding is punished more, specifically by low endowment players. We observe inequality aversion both in endowments and with respect to the interaction of endowments and contributions: high endowment players receive more punishment, but also receive more punishment for negative deviation from the group mean share.s}

This research investigates general attitudes of consumers relative to business, government and people in general, and compares these attitudes to their beliefs concerning various questionable consumer practices. The results show that consumers'' ethical beliefs are determined, in part, by who is at fault in the unethical behavior (the seller or the buyer). The results also indicate that those with a more positive attitude toward business are less likely to engage in questionable consumer practices, but one''s attitudes toward salespeople, the government and people in general arenot related to the consumer''s ethical beliefs.}

  pages = {1--40},
  abstract = {While impact evaluations can be used to measure the causal effect of a program, there are several potential factors that could challenge their external validity. First, it is possible that the projects that are selected for evaluation respond differently to treatment. If this is the case, the results of these evaluations will poorly predict the performance of future programs. Further, while Hawthorne effects could occur within a study, project implementers could also act differently when their project is being evaluated. In this case, the effect of the program would be confounded with the effect of the impact evaluation. Retrospective studies could also facilitate specification searching and be particularly selected. While others have considered these issues in individual cases, it has been difficult to gauge to what extent the problems are systemic. I use World Bank data on projects that did and did not receive impact evaluations and find a large gap in performance ratings between the projects that received impact evaluations and those that did not. Part of this difference may be a direct effect of the impact evaluations themselves improving project performance, however, part appears due to selection bias. Biases due to retrospective analysis appear largest of all.}

Using survey experiments at three universities in Austria and Germany (n = 578), we find that average donations of 14 Euros increased by 8 Euros in the treatment group that received information indicating that the project was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial (RCT). We find no effect for advertising that the organisation has earned a seal of quality. Since the majority of non-profits have already earned such a seal, people might become sceptical if an aid agency emphasises their trustworthiness, a trait that is assumed to be a given. Our results highlight that not only aid recipients but also aid organisations can benefit from adopting rigorously evaluated projects and carrying out RCTs in terms of increased income from charitable giving.}

Fish markets in this region are connected and organized into a hierarchical network. This structure of fish markets dramatically reduces the cost for geographically distanced fishermen and consumers to execute trades. However, the provision of the market itself requires entrepreneurial efforts. In this study, the market is conceptualized as a continuum of middlemen, whose entrepreneurial efforts of buying and selling make the market work. When the middleman makes profits, the market is at work. Otherwise, the market fails to emerge. Comparing the different ways of organizing fish transportation at two distinct villages, this paper shows that the choice of the market or the firm to organize fish transportation is determined by the cost of putting the market to work.}

By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.}

Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail.

Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Why and when do individuals pursue social goals rather than egoistic ones? My research develops and evaluates an explanation of how the "free-rider problem" of collective action can be overcome by individuals' desires for social status, and the availability of increased status for those who contribute to public goods. In a series of laboratory experiments, I show that contributors to collective action (a) enjoy improved status in the eyes of group members, (b) have greater influence on subsequent group tasks, and (c) benefit from "indirect reciprocity" in the form of gifts as well as higher rates of cooperation. Results suggest that contributions are a sign of generosity, rather than wealth or the ability to contribute (as suggested by most "costly signaling" accounts), or a sign of obligation to reciprocate (as suggested by exchange theory). A fourth study investigated the group-level impact of status rewards for contributions, indicating that they promote productivity, solidarity, and identification.}

Being ignored, excluded, and/or rejected signals a threat for which reflexive detection in the form of pain and distress is adaptive for survival. Brief ostracism episodes result in sadness and anger and threaten fundamental needs. Individuals then act to fortify or replenish their thwarted need or needs. Behavioral consequences appear to be split into two general categories: attempts to fortify relational needs (belonging, self-esteem, shared understanding, and trust), which lead generally to prosocial thoughts and behaviors, or attempts to fortify efficacy/existence needs of control and recognition that may be dealt with most efficiently through antisocial thoughts and behaviors. Available research on chronic exposure to ostracism appears to deplete coping resources, resulting in depression and helplessness.}

We first discuss the concept behind the definition of mental equilibrium and show that this behavioral equilibrium notion organizes quite well the results of some of the most popular experiments in the literature of experimental economics. We expose some attractive properties of mental equilibria which are useful for deriving the set of mental equilibria for specific games.},

Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

The result is a substantial degradation of punishment's ability to influence behavior.

This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on religious participation using a newly available individual-level panel data. Understanding these spillover effects may be quite important, given the existing literature that links religiosity to several economically important social behaviors. The results show that religious giving and participation are complements. Increasing the price of religious giving decreases not only religious contributions but also religious attendance. The implied cross-price elasticity of religious participation with respect to the after-tax price of giving is -0.27. Furthermore, a 1\% increase in the amount of religious contributions is associated with a 0.4\% increase in religious attendance. These results are robust under several different specifications and highlight the positive externalities created by charitable subsidies. They also have important implications for testing the validity of existing economic models of religious participation and giving.}

On the other hand, a growing body of literature documents that giving to others reduces the stress and strengthens the immune system, which results in better health and longer life expectancy. These findings imply that tax subsidies for charitable giving may have positive spillover effects on health. This paper investigates this hypothesis using data from Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), the philanthropy module of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID). Understanding the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on health is quite important given the existing literature that links health status to several important economic outcomes. The results show that charitable subsidies have positive spillover effects on health. In particular, the implied cross-price elasticity of health index with respect to giving is -0.13.

  abstract = {How do charitable donors respond to the third party ratings that signal the quality of charities? I investigate this question using a novel data set from Charity Navigator which provides quality ratings for 5400 charities. Since Charity Navigator prominently displays a charity{$\lnot^\circ\lnot$}\O s star rating which is assigned based on its overall rating, one can identify the causal impact of a one star increase in ratings on charitable contributions with a regression discontinuity framework that exploits the threshold values of the overall ratings. I find that in general, the third party ratings have a minor and often insignificant impact on charitable contributions received by charities. However, for relatively smaller and unknown charities, a higher rating leads to an increase in charitable contributions received. In particular, for these charities, I find that a one star increase in ratings is associated with a 19.5 percent increase in the amount of charitable contributions received. This result is robust under alternative model specifications and highlights the role of the third party ratings in not-for-profit markets.}

  abstract = {Fundraising campaigns advertised via mass media are common. To what extent such campaigns affect charitable behavior is mostly unknown, however. Using giving and volunteering surveys conducted biannually from 1988 to 1996, I investigate the effect of a national fundraising campaign, "Give Five", on charitable giving and volunteering patterns. The widely advertised "Give Five" campaign was aimed to encourage people to give five percent of their income and volunteer five hours a week. After controlling for selection into being informed about the "Give Five", I find that people who were informed about the campaign increased their weekly volunteering activity on average by almost half an hour, but their giving behavior was not significantly affected. I discuss the policy implications associated with this result and argue that although the "Give Five" campaign did not achieve its goal, its economic impact was considerable.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)}

  abstract = {People are more likely to contribute to a charity when they are asked to. Although this so-called `power of asking' is well-known among fundraisers, the existing literature does not pay much attention to the role of donation requests in charitable giving. This paper uses a unique survey that includes a question on whether the respondent is asked to give to estimate the causal effects of charitable solicitations on giving behavior. In order to address the endogeneity of the donation requests due to non-random solicitation of charitable donors, I link this survey to IRS data on charitable organizations and propose identifying instruments. After controlling for the endogeneity, I find that donation requests increase the propensity to give by about nineteen percentage points for those who are asked to give. This effect is robust under different specifications and with different sets of instruments, and is much larger than the estimates from univariate models, which assume that charitable solicitations are exogenous. I argue that this result is counterintuitive and discuss some possible explanations.},

Our results show that posting the NuVal score increases yogurt sales and the effect is larger for products with higher scores. This implies that experts are opinion influencers. Consumers respond positively to the better-nutrition signals provided by the NuVal score. The publicity effect of the new label is also at work.},

Consequently, exchanges are more attractive to informed traders, and dark pools are more attractive to uninformed traders. Under certain conditions, adding a dark pool alongside an exchange concentrates price-relevant information into the exchange and improves price discovery. Improved price discovery coincides with reduced exchange liquidity.}

We attempted to replicate Studies 1 and 2 of Fetherstonhaugh et al. (1997) (5 data collections, total N~=~4799, MTurk and Prolific, USA and UK), and added several extensions (e.g., donation amounts, procedural differences, and individual-level ideology and knowledge). We found mixed support, with two successful replications of Study 2 that indeed showed psychophysical numbing (original: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.55, 90\% CI [0.45, 0.62], Study 2a: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.62, 90\% CI [0.58, 0.66], Study 2b: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.24, 90\% CI [0.21, 0.27], all in same direction), yet also three unsuccessful replications of Study 1 showing instead an opposite psychophysical sensitization, a preference for saving a smaller proportion of lives (original effect size: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.14, 90\% CI [0.02, 0.28], replications: Study 1a: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.06, 90\% CI [0.02, 0.10], Study 1b: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.21, 90\% CI [0.17, 0.26]; Study 1c: {$\eta$}2p~=~0.13, 90\% CI [0.08, 0.17], all in the opposite direction). We discuss theoretical implications and potential drivers of psychophysical numbing and sensitization, including evaluation mode, comparison procedure, ideology, knowledge, and prioritizing of one's own country, and practical implications for research on perceptions of charity, aid effectiveness, and donations.
